All proprietary notices incorporated in or affixed to any Software, documentation or materials shall be duplicated by Customer on all copies and shall not be altered, removed or obliterated. Customer may not, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part: (a) modify, translate, reverse engineer, decrypt, disassemble, decompile, create derivative works based on, or otherwise attempt to discover the Software source code or underlying ideas, techniques or algorithms, including the review of data structures or similar materials produced by the Software; (b) lease, rent, loan, commercially share (including time-share or electronically transmitting over a network to a third party) or otherwise permit use of the Software in connection with a service bureau or other configuration whereby any third party may use the Software; (c) use versions of third party products embedded in Software, if any, for any use other than the intended use of the Software; (d) combine the Software with prohibited software (software that is distributed as free software, open source software or similar licensing/distribution models or distributed under the GNU General Public License); (e) use the Software in connection with any ultra hazardous activity; (f) release the results of benchmark testing using the Licensor Software; and (g)

\ulnone\strike0\par\pard\fs16 3. Maintenance.

(e) Neither party will be responsible for performance delays caused by circumstances outside its reasonable control.   (f) The failure of either party to enforce at any time any of the provisions of this Agreement shall in no way be construed as a waiver of any part thereof or the right to thereafter enforce every such provision.                                               
\ulnone\strike0\par\pard\fs13 (g) This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding of the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement, and supersedes all previous agreements, statements and understandings from or between the parties regarding the subject matter hereof. Customer\rquote s assent to this Agreement will be presumed from Customer\rquote s submission of its purchase order. Where there is a conflict between the terms of this Agreement and a Customer purchase order, the terms of this Agreement shall control. Any pre-printed terms and conditions in Customer\rquote s purchase order shall be invalid under this Agreement. No addition to or modification of the terms of this Agreement shall be binding upon Licensor unless specifically agreed to by Licensor in writing.  If Customer\rquote s purchase order or other correspondence contains terms or conditions contrary to or in addition to the terms and conditions contained herein or in Licensor\rquote s quote, acceptance of any order by Licensor shall not be construed as assent to such contrary or additional terms and conditions or constitute a waiver by Licensor of any of the terms and conditions contained herein or in Licensor\rquote s quote.  Licensor\rquote s acceptance of Customer\rquote s purchase order (which Licensor may communicate via electronic notification to Customer) is expressly conditioned on Customer\rquote s assent to these terms and conditions.
