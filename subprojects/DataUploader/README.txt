***CambridgeSoft’s ChemBioOffice Enterprise 11.0.3***

The console data-loading application (COE DataLoader 2) provides command-line support for validating,
determining matches for, and loading Registration data. Using a variety of command-line arguments,
it can run unattended or a user can monitor console messages. Generates and presents a complete
activity log as a human-readable text file at the end of each execution.


Core Benefits:
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
1 - ability to match external data against pre-registered compounds based on either structural or configurable,
    property-specific comparison, all without actually loading the data

2 - highly-flexible, xml-based configuration: extensive options include custom properties, identifiers, projects,
    salts and solvates, and more

3 - support for import of MS Excel spreadsheets and MS Access tables for Microsoft Office 2007 and 2010

4 - includes tasks to discover information about data-files: record-counts, field names and types
    (text, numbers or dates), worksheet or table names (MS Excel and MS Access, respectively)

5 - rule-centric data-validation: when external data doesn’t match your administrative configuration,
    it is bypassed and the reasons logged.

6 - *unattended processing based on task scheduling, Windows command files (‘batch’ files) or control by
    an external program

7 – power-user tools: mixture creation from registered compound lists; external-value translations for
    non-compliant raw data (ex. external username translations, 3rd party salt-code conversions, etc.)

* requires user credentials to be included


Known issues:
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
CSBR-134627 -- In some environments, at the end of an import from a spreadsheet, the command-line freezes
after processing has been completed and the log file has been displayed.
