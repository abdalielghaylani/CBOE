Process for developing a csbr fix that needs patching xmls:

a) Create a folder for your file, if not present.
	- It is recomended to have your new class in a folder that represents the target the csbr is.
	- If there is no folder that fits this you should create one and name it TargetYOURTARGET, IE Target11.0.3

b) Add a new class to that folder and name it CSBRNUMBER. IE: CSBR188788
	- Use the following Namespace: CambridgeSoft.COE.Patcher

c) Inherit abstract class BugFixCommand
d) Be sure your class have a public constructor without parameters
e) Implement the Fix(...) method.
	- Identify the xml you need to modify from the paramaters being passed.
	- Modify them carefully, trying to be as much specific as possible for the xpath selectors, having in mind that 
  the xml might have been modified by the customer already.

f) In the PatchList folder look for the text file for the csbr target you have fixed and add the CSBRNUMBER to the end of that file
	- If the file is not there create one. Name it TARGET.txt. IE: 11.0.3.txt
