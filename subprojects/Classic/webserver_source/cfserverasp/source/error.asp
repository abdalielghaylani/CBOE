 </P>

<H2>Error: Java Inactive</H2>

<P><BR>
<BR>
</P>

<P>The ChemDraw Plug-In is unable to function because your 
browser does not support Java or has Java turned off. The ChemDraw Plug-In must 
be able to access Java in order to function. Please re-activate Java for your 
browser, and try accessing the page again. (Unfortunately, the name and location 
of the menu item for re-activating Java varies from browser to browser and even 
from version to version of the same browser. Your best bet is to consult the 
documentation for your own browser if you cannot locate this option.) If you 
continue to have problems with the CS ChemDraw Plug-In, please submit a <A
 
href="http://www.camsoft.com/support/suppProbRep.html">problem report form</A> and someone from the CambridgeSoft Technical 
Support Department will get right back to you.</P>

<%Case "cookies_off"%>
 </P>

<H2>Error: Cookies Disabled</H2>

<P><BR>
<BR>
</P>

<P>The ChemOffice Webserver depends heavily on useing client side cookies and it appears that your browswer has this ability disabled.  You will not be able to perform searches or retrieve results without this functionality. Please enable cookies in your browser setting the Preferences dialog box (Netscape) or Internet Options dialog box (Internet Explorer). 
</P>

<%Case "java_security"%>

<H2>Error: Java Security Error Detected</H2>

<P><BR>
<BR>
</P>

<P>The ChemDraw Plug-In is unable to function because the 
security level in your browser is set too high. When you loaded the Advanced 
Query with Plug-in page, you should have been prompted with an alert asking if 
you wanted to grant permissions to the Plug-In. It is vital that you grant those 
permissions, or the Plug-in will not work. You should return to the search page 
and press the Reload button on your browser; in most cases that should present 
you with the alert again, and allow you to grant the required permissions. If 
you want, many browsers will allow you to specify security settings manually 
through an appropriate menu item. Unfortunately, the name and location of that 
menu item vary from browser to browser and even from version to version of the 
same browser. Your best bet is to consult the documentation for your own 
browser. If you continue to have problems with the CS ChemDraw Plug-In, please 
submit a <A
 href="http://www.camsoft.com/support/suppProbRep.html">problem report form</A> and someone from the CambridgeSoft Technical 
Support Department will get right back to you.</P>
