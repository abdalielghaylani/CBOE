<h3>Get us your data</h3>
<p>Our best piece of advice is the simplest: Get us your data. Somehow. If you 
get us <i>something</i>, we can include you in ChemACX. If we have nothing, we 
can't. If you ignore everything else on this page, you'll be Just Fine, as long 
as we have your data at all.</p>
<hr>
<h3>More is better than less</h3>
<p>If you have a choice of giving us more data or less, give us more. Maybe 
we'll end up ignoring some of it, but maybe we'll find a use for it if we have 
it. If we don't have it, we can't use it. And the more data we can present about 
your products, the more likely that a potential customer will find them when 
searching ChemACX, and buy the substance from you.</p>
<h3>Electronic data is better than printed</h3>
<p>Electronic data gets processed first. If you <i>only</i> have a printed 
catalog, we'll cheerfully accept it, but we will process any other electronic 
catalogs we receive before we worry about re-keying your printed volume. We'll 
get to it, eventually, but it won't be at the top of our priority list. Sorry!</p>
<h3>Fielded data is better than not</h3>
<p>Among electronic data, we much prefer information that is fielded. &quot;Fielded&quot; 
data means that each piece of information is labeled -- somehow -- as to its type. 
Some common &quot;fielded&quot; data formats include SD Files, Excel spreadsheets, 
tab-delimited text files, CSV files, XML files, and just about every database 
you can think of. Most Microsoft Word documents are not fielded (although they 
might be). If you have a database that you use to keep track of products within 
your own company and could simply send us a copy, that would be ideal, but it's 
certainly not mandatory. If you have a choice of providing fielded data or not, 
fielded data is better, but don't worry about converting from one fielded form 
to another -- they're all the same to us. If you can't provide fielded data, 
don't worry about it. Just get us something.</p>
<h3>Identify your products</h3>
<p>It should be obvious, but we need to know what you're selling. Be sure to 
include <i>some</i> sort of identification for each substance, usually at least 
one name, CAS RN, or chemical structure. Of course, as above, &quot;more is better&quot;.</p>
<h3>Include part numbers</h3>
<p>Will customers need to reference a specific part number when ordering from 
you? If you don't include it, we can't provide it to the potential customers.</p>
<h3>Include packaging information</h3>
<p>Do you sell a given product in a 1 mL vial, a 100-gram bottle, or a 1-ton 
tanker? If you don't tell us, we can't tell the potential customers.</p>
<h3>Include pricing</h3>
<p>Customers like pricing information. They like it. A lot. If a customer likes 
you, they're more likely to buy from you, no?</p>
<h3>Can we contact you for questions?</h3>
<p>We will often find, shall we say, &quot;oddities&quot; when processing chemical 
catalogs, simply because our <a href="process.asp">
production process</a> is so thorough. If there is someone we could contact with 
technical questions about the content of your catalog, we might be able to 
present it more accurately than we could do otherwise. Let us know who we can 
talk to, if anyone.</p>
<h3>Do you want corrections?</h3>
<p>We often find typo-level errors in chemical catalogs. Where the errors are 
obvious (such as the ubiquitous &quot;ehtyl&quot;, &quot;napthyl&quot;, &quot;naphtyl&quot;, &quot;cloro&quot;, &quot;choro&quot;, 
and &quot;flouro&quot;), we will make the corrections automatically. If you like, we would 
be happy to provide you a report of issues of this sort in your data so that you 
can improve it for all of your potential customers, not just the ones that 
access your catalog through ChemACX. If you would like this, let us know.
