CambridgeSoft Corporation can provide other services relating to chemical 
catalogs. The items discussed here have nothing to do with ChemACX. We would 
love to have you participate in ChemACX whether or not you are interested in 
anything listed here. In fact, we expect that most companies that participate in 
ChemACX would <i>not</i> be interested in these items.
<p>For the most part, these items only make sense for catalogs with at least 
1,000 items, and only make a lot of sense for catalogs with at least 10,000 
items. There are plenty of companies that sell dozens or hundreds of compounds. 
That's absolutely fine. There are other companies that are already undertaking 
these activities on their own. That's also fine (although we might be able to 
save you money if we did it). Many other companies simply don't care. All fine. 
These options are listed for those companies who <i>do</i> care.</p>
<h3>CD-ROM Production</h3>
<p>CD-ROM-based catalogs are creative and powerful marketing pieces to distribute 
with, or as an alternative to, traditional paper catalogs. Using the industry-standard
ChemDraw and ChemOffice software, CambridgeSoft can create a structure-searchable
version of your own chemical catalog. Thumbing through paper catalog books, or even
searching through an electronic product list, is often insufficient when searching
for a substance that has a dozen synonyms. Chemical property and structure searching
ensure that if you offer a product, someone looking for it will find it quickly.
Customers appreciate this timesaving convenience.</p>
<h3>Website Hosting</h3>
<p>In addition to the convenience offered by a CD-ROM, a WWW-based catalog created
and hosted by CambridgeSoft may also include a storefront, a shopping cart and
online procurement system, real-time availability information for customers, and an
internal inventory tracking system for your business. Our chemically intelligent
software, our knowledge of the chemical produrement process, and our experience
in developing creative and user-friendly electronic catalog systems are unmatched.
These CambridgeSoft competencies combine to provide a positive buying experience for 
your customers.</p>
<h3>Advertising</h3>
<p>Advertise in <a href="http://chemnews.cambridgesoft.com">ChemNews.Com</a> 
magazine or send a promotional message to our email subscribers. Each of our print
and email subscriber lists number over 250,000 buying chemists.</p>
