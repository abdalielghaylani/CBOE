Instructions to Export the Whole Contents of the Chemical Inventory Database

1. Execute the ExpChemInvDB.cmd file which uses the Oracle export utility to extract the entire contents of ChemInv database using the exp file as a parameter file.

2. Make a back copy of the ChemInv.msi and ChemInv.mst files located in the path specified in the ChemInv.ini file.

The resulting cheminvdb.dmp file can be imported into an empty ChemInv database by using the Oracle import utilty as discussed in the instruction to create an empty ChemInv database.
	Note: You will need to modify the inp parameter file to use the resulting dmp file instead of Test_ChemInvDb.dmp file.
