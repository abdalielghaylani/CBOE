A chemical vendor should participate in ChemACX for the same reason that you 
produce your own catalog or product list in the first place: because customers 
can't buy your products if they don't know what products you sell.
<p>Some companies use ChemACX as their primary source for chemical purchasing -- 
if you are not listed in ChemACX, you will not be able to get business from 
those companies at all.</p>
<p>Others use ChemACX as one of several sources for their chemical purchasing, 
in which case they might already have your catalog. But even if they do, would 
they be able to find the substances they are looking for in it? Our painstaking <a href="process.asp">
production process</a> extends the scope of your catalog by adding synonyms, 
properties, and chemical structures that you might not otherwise have had. 
ChemACX provides many ways to search for substances, including advanced chemical 
structure searching over all substances in the database. The more ways that a 
researcher <i>can</i> find compound from your catalog, the more likely it is 
that they <i>will</i> find it, and then order it from you.</p>
<p>Participation in ChemACX is absolutely, totally, and completely FREE. There 
is no monetary charge for participating, and there are no hidden charges either.</p>
<p>The only thing we need from you is the obvious: we need your catalog. We do
<i>not</i> need you to process your catalog in any special way, and in fact we 
would prefer that you didn't. If you have an existing catalog, just send us a 
copy -- all the better if it's in some electronic form. Some vendors may be able 
to send us the raw data dumped out of their own internal inventory or 
fulfillment system; that would be fine as well. Whatever you can provide us, we 
can work with.</p>
<p>It's easy, it's free, and it will only get you more customers. Why not 
participate in ChemACX?</td></tr></table>
