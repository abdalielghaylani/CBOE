    <font face="Arial" size="2"><p>The Simple query form in ChemACX.Com is designed to make it as easy as possible to
    locate chemicals.. You may enter a chemical <b>name</b> or <b>CAS Registry Number</b>.
    ChemACX.Com identifies the type of search you want, and provides the hits accordingly.</p>
    <p>If you would like to use advanced features, or plan on <strong>structure searching</strong>,
    <a href="http://store.camsoft.com/store/merchant.cfm?pid=93&step=4">download the ChemDraw Plug-in</a> (FREE) and use the Advanced Query page. The Advanced query
    also offers more precise control over all search terms, and lets you specify boolean
    criteria.</p></font>

    <font face="Arial" size="2"><p><b>Name</b></a> searches will look for your standard chemical names, such as
    '1,4-dimethylbenzene' or 'cyclobutadiene'. An asterisk (*) serves as a wildcard, allowing
    the creation of &quot;name starts with&quot;, &quot;name ends with&quot;, and &quot;name
    contains&quot; searches. For example, '*benzene' will match '1,2-dichlorobenzene'. </p>
    <p>Name searches also search an exhaustive synonym list. Even if a supplier doesn't have
    that name for their compound in their catalog, ChemACX.Com has a large library of synonyms
    which is used in the search.</p></font>

        Registry Number</b></font></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <font face="Arial" size="2"><p><b>CAS Registry Number</b></a> searches attempt to locate a substance by its Chemical
    Abstracts Service Registry Number. The standard format for a CAS RN is xxxxxx-xx-x, but
    ChemACX.Com recognizes the same number as valid even without the dashes. Leading zeroes
    are optional. Since the last digit of each CAS RN is a built-in checksum, ChemACX.Com is
    able to recognize many of the more common mistypings.</p></font>
