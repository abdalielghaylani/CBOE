<p>ChemACX is a structurally searchable index of chemicals that are commercially available for purchase 
from suppliers worldwide. </p>
<p>By sheer numbers, most of the substances within ChemACX are fine chemicals -- 
chemically-interesting small molecules available in small quantities primarily 
for research purposes. A smaller number of substances may be classified as bulk 
chemicals -- substances that are generally simple, chemically, and available in 
quantities ranging from kilograms to tanker cars or larger. Few bulk chemicals 
are listed within ChemACX because there are relatively few substances commercially 
available in bulk scale. </p>
<p>Any substance may be included in ChemACX as long as it might reasonably 
participate in a subsequent chemical reaction. So, not only does ChemACX include 
many pure substances, but many simple mixtures as well. Materials used by 
chemists during the course of chemical synthesis but not actually participating 
in the synthetic reaction would generally not be included in ChemACX: items such 
as glassware, equipment, and software are absent from this index.</p>
<p>Suppliers listed in ChemACX range from multinational corporations providing 
tens or hundreds of thousands of unique substances to small custom houses that 
offer only a few compounds. Any vendor may be included in ChemACX as long as 
they are the primary provider for a given substances. Vendors that simply resell 
chemicals they obtain from other suppliers would generally not qualify for 
listing on their own. Thus, Morton might be included in ChemACX as a vendor of 
sodium chloride, but every individual convenience store would not be listed 
simply because they also sell table salt.</p>
<p>CambridgeSoft does not sell or resell chemicals directly. Instead, each 
substance entry within ChemACX is accompanied by a list of vendors from which it 
is available, along with contact information for each supplier. When suppliers 
are able to provide other information to us, that information will also be 
presented to the user of ChemACX. Packaging sizes and pricing details are 
especially useful to researchers who know what substances they are looking to 
buy, and are simply trying to select a preferred vendor. Physical property 
information is especially useful to chemists who do not know what specific 
chemical they are looking for, but who do have an idea of how it is 
characterized. In all cases, information is presented as accurately as possible, 
but all researchers are encouraged to contact the original suppliers to confirm 
critical details before any purchase. </p>
<p>Researchers appreciate ChemACX because it provides a single index to hundreds 
of chemical catalogs. Perhaps more importantly, researchers appreciate it 
because ChemACX is <i>searchable</i>, often in ways that simply aren't possible 
with printed catalogs or even in the electronic catalogs provided by individual 
suppliers. What one vendor offers as &quot;methylene chloride&quot; another might list 
only as &quot;dichloromethane&quot;, and a third might reference by formula or CAS 
Registry Number. Once these various identifiers have been reconciled by the 
trained chemists employed by CambridgeSoft, users of ChemACX can locate 
substances using the terms suggested by any supplier. Perhaps more importantly, 
the vendor-supplied 
substance information is combined by other data generated by CambridgeSoft, 
making ChemACX fully <i>substructure searchable</i> as well. When that precalculated 
information is combined with other CambridgeSoft technologies such as the 
automated conversion of chemical names to structures, the number of ways to 
search ChemACX is literally infinite.</p>
<p>The data within ChemACX is provided to users in many forms. Perhaps most 
popular is a simple subscription-based model. Users (either individuals or 
entire organizations) can pay a yearly fee to access the latest version of the 
database from a secure web server at CambridgeSoft. Some companies are so 
security-conscious that they do not allow external web access; those companies 
might be interested in setting up a mirror copy of the database within their own 
private intranet. ChemACX is also available on CD-ROM, and ships in secured form 
(viewing is allowed, but not bulk exporting) with every copy of ChemOffice. 
Unsecured versions, which do allow exporting, are also available; those 
unsecured versions are most popular among researchers who are doing 
high-throughput screening and need direct access to the entire collection of 
structure files in bulk. We also provide a free public preview of the ChemACX 
database at <a href="http://chemacx.cambridgesoft.com">
http://chemacx.cambridgesoft.com</a>, but only a few dozen vendors are listed at 
the free site.</p>
<p>ChemACX is updated twice a year, in March and September. As of the March, 
2004 release, it contained over 300,000 substances representing 600,000 products 
(over 900,000 individual SKUs) from over 350 chemical vendors.</p>
<p>More and more researchers -- and even entire corporations -- are using 
ChemACX as the primary reference for all of their chemical sourcing needs.</p>
