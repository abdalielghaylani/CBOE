<h1>Inventory Loader</h1>
<p>Inventory Loader is an application to load information from ChemFinder 
databases into the Inventory Enterprise and Registration System databases. </p>
<p>ChemFinder databases may be created from many sources, most commonly SDFiles. 
SDFiles are the common currency of chemical information exchange today. </p>
<p>Inventory Loader may be run from any machine with access to the ChemOffice 
Enterprise application server. </p>
<p>To start loading compounds into Inventory Loader:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Start the Inventory Loader application. An 
  introduction screen appears. <br><strong>NOTE</strong>: You must start the Inventory Enterprise application 
  before using InvLoader. 
  <li>Click <strong>Next</strong>. 
  <li>Enter the name of the ChemOffice Enterprise application server, your 
  username, and your password. <br><strong>NOTE:</strong> The username 
  you use here must have sufficient privileges to add compounds to and create 
  plates in the Inventory Enterprise system. If you want to register those 
  compounds, you must have sufficient privileges on the Registration System. 
  <li>Click <strong>Next</strong>. <br><strong>NOTE:</strong> If an error message appears saying no 
  plate locations or plate formats are defined, you will have to configure at 
  least one location in Inventory Enterprise to hold plates, and/or create at least 
  one valid plate format. Consult the documentation for Inventory Enterprise. 
  <li>Browse to the ChemFinder database you want to load. 
  <li>Select whether you wish to <a href="#plates">load 
  compounds into plates</a>, or <a href="#componly">just load compounds</a>. </li></ol>
<a name="plates"></a><h2>Loading Compounds into Plates </h2>
<ol>
  <li>Click <strong>Next</strong>. <br><strong>NOTE</strong>: If an error message appears saying 
  &#147;Cannot open database&#148;, you may need to upgrade the database to the current 
  ChemFinder version. To do this, simply open the database within ChemFinder and 
  follow the prompts. <br>A table appears. <br>The table&#146;s left column 
  <span lang="en-us">displays</span> 
  the <span lang="en-us">fields</span> in Inventory Enterprise. <br>The table&#146;s second column lets you choose to 
  either enter a default value, or to pick a field from your Chem<span lang="en-us">F</span>inder database 
  to insert into that field. If you choose Use Default, you can enter that 
  default value in the 3rd column. The default is to leave the field blank. 
  <li>Enter information for one or more fields. The 
  following is an explanation of the fields: <br>
  <table cellSpacing="1" cellPadding="1" width="75%" border="1">
    
    <tr style="COLOR: khaki" bgColor="darkblue">
      <td width="30%"><strong>Field Name</strong></td>
      <td><strong>Field Description</strong></td></tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Well Coordinate</td>
      <td>the address of the well on the plate, e.g. &#147;A02&#148; or &#147;H12&#148;</td></tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Row </td>
      <td>the row of the well on the plate, either in letter or number 
      format.</td></tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Column </td>
      <td>the column of the well on the plate, in number format. </td></tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Reg Number </td>
      <td>the CambridgeSoft registration number of the compound. You will 
        generally leave this blank unless you are importing data from the 
        Registration System into Inventory Enterprise.</td></tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Batch Number </td>
      <td>the CambridgeSoft registration batch number of the compound. You 
        will generally leave this blank unless you are importing data from the 
        Registration System into Inventory Enterprise.</td></tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Barcode </td>
      <td>the barcode of the plate. This is the barcode that will be used in 
        Inventory Enterprise. If you leave this blank, Inventory Enterprise will 
        assign new barcodes to the plates according to a scheme which you set up 
        in a later screen. </td></tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Compound Name </td>
      <td>an identifier for the compound. </td></tr>
    <tr>
      <td>CAS Number </td>
      <td>the CAS number for the compound. Many screening libraries do not 
        include CAS numbers. </td></tr>
    <tr>
      <td>ChemACX ID</td>
      <td>the CambridgeSoft ChemACX id for the compound. Many screening 
        libraries do not include ChemACX numbers. </td></tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Supplier </td>
      <td>the supplier of the plate. </td></tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Supplier Barcode </td>
      <td>the barcode assigned by the supplier to the plate. If you will be 
        re-barcoding the plates upon import, you may assign the original 
        supplier barcode to this field for tracking purposes. </td></tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Supplier Compound ID</td>
      <td>supplier&#146;s identifier for the compound </td></tr></table><br>The remainder of the 
  fields should be self-explanatory. <br><strong>NOTE</strong>: You do not have 
  to fill in all fields. <br><br>Some notes on filling in this 
  grid: 
  <ol><li>Either Well Coordinate or Row AND Column may be 
    mapped to ChemFinder fields. It is not necessary to map both, and you don&#146;t 
    have to do either, but if you map Row, you must map Column. If you map Well 
    Coordinate, you shouldn&#146;t map Row or Column. 
    <li>If your plates have identifiers, you should map that identifier to 
    either Barcode, Supplier Barcode, or (if the plate identifier is numeric) to 
    Supplier Plate Number. If you don&#146;t, you will receive a warning, and the 
    compounds will probably not be plated according to your expectations. 
    <li>If you map only Supplier Barcode, Supplier Plate Number, or Barcode, and 
    you do NOT map Well Coordinate or Row AND Column, the compounds will 
    probably not be plated correctly. 
    <li>If you do not map ANY of: Supplier Barcode, 
    Supplier Plate Number, or Barcode, Well Coordinate or Row AND Column, then 
    the compounds will be put into plates in the order that they are encountered 
    in the file. This is probably a rare scenario.<br>         
                
                  
            &nbsp;</li>             
                 
                  
        </ol>
    <li>Click <strong>Next</strong>. 
  <li>Choose the location where you want to create the plates. 
  <li>Choose the plate format you wish to use. The plate format describes the 
  size of the plate (96, 384 well), as well as the layout of the plates &#150; where 
  compounds are located, which wells are empty. 
  <li>Choose the plate type you wish to create. The Plate Types list is an 
  arbitrary list of types. The number of compounds being imported and the number 
  of plates to be created appear at the bottom of this screen. This is a good 
  place to check if the results are what you expected. 
  <li>Click <strong>Next</strong>. 
  <li>Choose the library to assign the plates to. <br>This is an arbitrary list 
  of classifications. 
  <li>Enter how you want Inventory Enterprise to barcode your plates. 
  <br><strong>NOTE</strong>: If you have mapped a ChemFinder field to Barcode in 
  a previous screen, the Barcode section of this screen will be grayed out, 
  indicating that the barcodes from your file will be used. 
  <li>Assign a starting group number for your plates if desired. This is rarely 
  used. 
  <li>Click <strong>Next</strong>. 
  <li>If you want to register these compounds into the Registration System, 
  check the box. <br>Inventory Loader will validate your login against the 
  registration system. <br>If it succeeds, a grid containing the options for 
  registering the compounds appears. You can choose what project, prefix and 
  sequence to register the compounds with, as well as other options. For more 
  documentation on what these choices mean, consult the Registration System 
  documentation. 
  <ol><li>If you want to assign fields to be filled in for 
    the compound when it is registered, click Registration Options&#133; 
    <li>A dialog appears, with a table similar to the one you used to assign 
    inventory fields. Here you can choose default values or SDFile fields to 
    assign to registration system fields. <br><strong>NOTE</strong>: Please note 
    that the fields here are named as they are in the database, not as they are 
    in the Registration System interface. The mapping between display name and 
    database name may be found in 
    C:\inetpub\wwwroot\chemoffice\chem_reg\config\cfserver.ini</li>   
                    
               
          
     </ol>
    <li>Click <strong>Next</strong>. 
  <li>If you would like to save a log of the plates that were created in XML 
  format, check the box and specify a path. <br>This is usually not necessary 
  unless you are experiencing problems. 
  <li>Click <strong>Next</strong>. 
  <li>Click <strong>Finish</strong>  and the plates are imported. Each plate may take a while, as 
  compounds are duplicate-checked and indexed for searching. </li></ol>
<a name="componly"></a><h2>Import Compounds Only </h2>

  <li>A screen of inventory fields that can be mapped to 
  ChemFinder fields appears. See step 2. on page 2 for more information.
