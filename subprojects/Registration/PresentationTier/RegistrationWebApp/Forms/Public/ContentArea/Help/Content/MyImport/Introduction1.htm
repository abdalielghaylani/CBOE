        <div class="Body">Welcome to Registration Enterprise. Registration lets you register your organization's compounds and mixtures to a common database. You can add, search, and edit the compounds and batches and share registration records over a network through a simple and user-friendly graphical interface. Any user can immediately track the records you submit, enabling them to gather information stored in the database easily and quickly.</div>
        <div class="Body">Users can enter data and administrators can manage user accounts using simple Web forms. Registration detects any data entry errors before registering the compound in the database.</div>
        <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="Introduction_3358748554_999209"></a><a name="kanchor2"></a><a name="kanchor3"></a>The registration process</h3>
        <div class="Body">The registration process requires two steps. First, a user, the submitter (typically a chemist), enters chemical data into Registration. The data is stored in a temporary table. The submitter can search, edit, or delete the data as desired. Next, the Registrar (typically a senior chemist or lab manager) reviews the submitted data. If the Registrar decides the data is acceptable, he or she registers the data in a permanent database.</div>

        </p>
        <div class="Body">In registration system:</div>
        <div class="Bullet1-1st">Registration assigns a unique number to each record in the permanent table to identify it. The registration ID can be used to search the record. </div>
        <div class="Bullet1-last">Registration checks for duplicate records whenever a compound is registered in the permanent table. You can choose to either register the compound as a duplicate or a batch or keep it in the temporary table without registering.</div>
        <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="Introduction_3358748554_999232"></a><a name="kanchor4"></a>Integration</h3>
        <div class="Body">Registration can be integrated with other  CambridgeSoft applications such as Inventory Enterprise, ChemACX database, BioSAR Enterprise, BioAssay Enterprise, and E-Notebook. When integrated, Registration provides a solution to the problems associated with organizing, storing, and sharing chemical information. Each product shares information through common databases. Each product also provides interfaces to operations performed in different applications. For example, you can register a compound in Registration Enterprise through E-Notebook or BioAssay HTS. Sharing a common database makes all information consistent with a change in any one application.This means that every user in the research and development process has access to the up-to-date data. It saves time and reduces the number of errors in re-interpreting and re-entering data in multiple locations. </div>

        <div class="Body">You can link Registration Enterprise to any of these ChemBioOffice Enterprise applications, if they are installed:</div>
        <h5 class="HeadingRunIn">Inventory Enterprise</h5>
        <div class="Body"> you can search compounds in Registration Enterprise using Inventory Enterprise. This lets you include the compounds in Registration Enterprise in inventory containers without re-entering data. You can also send Registration Enterprise search results to Inventory Enterprise. Any changes made to the record in the Registration Enterprise is immediately reflected in       Inventory Enterprise. </div>
        <h5 class="HeadingRunIn">ChemACX</h5>
        <div class="Body">you can register compounds from a catalog listing. This populates the registration record with all the data in the ChemACX record.</div>
        <h5 class="HeadingRunIn">BioSAR Enterprise</h5>
        <div class="Body"> you can search the registration data and biological data and create a report containing only the information you want.</div>
        <h5 class="HeadingRunIn">BioAssay HTS</h5>
        <div class="Body"> you can register a compound in Registration Enterprise through BioAssay HTS.</div>
        <h5 class="HeadingRunIn">E-Notebook</h5>
        <div class="Body"> you can register a compound in Registration Enterprise through E-Notebook.</div>
