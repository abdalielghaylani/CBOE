This command will read a list of users from tab delimited file.

The tab delimited file can be completed by filling out the included csv in Microsoft Excel.

CSS_USER is added to all users automatically so it does not need to be in the sheet.

Roles should be a comma delimited list of EXISTING COE Roles. A blank means that only CSS_USER will get assigned.

If Site has been populated they will automatically get added to the system and mapped for each user.

Supervisor should be the username of the supervisor.  They will get converted to ids once all users have been loaded.
