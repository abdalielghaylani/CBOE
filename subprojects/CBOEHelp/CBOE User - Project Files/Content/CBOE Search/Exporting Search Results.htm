        <h1>Exporting Search Results</h1>
        <p>You can save a hit list as a SD file.
</p>
        <p>When you export to a file, you use a template to define which fields are included. Always use the same template to ensure that you always select the same fields each time you export.
</p>
        <p>To export search results or hit lists:
 </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Go to File&gt;Export Hits. The Export Hits window appears. </li>
            <li>Select a type of SD file: 

</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/CBOE Search/export form.gif" />
        </p>
        <p><b>Flat
</b>
        </p>
        <p>Select this type to create multiple results for one field (a record is created for each result).
</p>
        <p><b>Nested
</b>
        </p>
        <p>Select this type when multiple results for one field all appear in one cell.
 </p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Choose the template from the Export Templates drop-down list. </li>
            <li> (Optional) If needed, select/deselect the fields under Export. 
 </li>
            <li>Click OK. A new window opens. </li>
            <li>Click Click to Download. The File Download dialog box appears, containing a numerical name for the file, based on the date and time. 
 </li>
            <li>Click Save to display the Save As dialog box. 
 </li>
            <li> Select a location. 
 </li>
            <li>Click Save. 

</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The exported file flattens each record so that a compound with subform fields, such as multiple batches in the Registration Enterprise is found within one record in the exported file. All subform data is concatenated with '--' between fields. The first line indicate the field names.
