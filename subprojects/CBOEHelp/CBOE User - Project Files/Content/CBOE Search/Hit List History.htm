        <h1>Hit List History</h1>
        <p>You can retrieve a hitlist that was executed in the current session, even if the hitlist was not saved. The history is cleared periodically, based on the application configuration. Consult your system administrator for more information about history clearance.
</p>
        <p>To restore a hitlist in your history:
 </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Go to History&gt; Hit lists. The History window appears. 
 </li>
            <li>Select the hit list from the drop-down list. </li>
            <li>Click Restore. 
</li>
        </ol>
