        <h1>Query History</h1>
        <p>You can retrieve a query that was executed in the current session, even if the query was not saved. The history is cleared periodically, based on the application configuration. Consult your system administrator for more information about history clearance.
</p>
        <p>To restore a query in your history:
 </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Go to History&gt; Queries. The Queries window appears. 
 </li>
            <li>Select the query from the drop-down list. </li>
            <li>Click Restore. 
</li>
        </ol>
