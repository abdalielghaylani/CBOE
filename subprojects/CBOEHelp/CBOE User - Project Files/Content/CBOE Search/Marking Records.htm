        <p>You can mark records (added to a progressive hit list) in either the Details or List views. Marked hits are user specific and can be retrieved at any time.
</p>
        <p>To mark a record:
</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>In List View: Click the Mark Record button corresponding to the record that you want to mark.
</li>
            <li>In Details View: Click the Mark Record button in the upper left hand corner of the record that you want to mark. 
</li>
        </ul>
        <p><i><b>Note:</b> The record is marked and the button changes to Unmark Record button. To remove the record from the marked records list, click the Unmark Record button.
</i>
        </p>
        <p>To view the marked records, go to Marked Hits &gt; Show Marked. The marked records are loaded into the current hit list and displayed.
