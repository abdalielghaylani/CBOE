        <h1>ChemBioViz - Spotfire Integration</h1>
        <p>ChemBioViz provides a data organization layer (Dataview) and a flexible and configurable user interface layer for the search and display of scientific data stored in databases, that includes forms, tables, grids and card views of structures and data.

</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Default.Not supported in 1261">Spotfire is a state-of-the-art data visualization and analysis application that provides a rich set of tools and display options to allow interactive exploration of multi-parameter data sets. </p>
        <p>The intent of the ChemBioViz/Spotfire Integration is to provide a linkage between the two applications so the scientists can take advantage of the strengths of both systems in an interactive and seamless manner.    </p>
        <p>When a scientist displays forms in ChemBioViz and run queries, the resulting hit list displayed in ChemBioViz may be pushed directly into Spotfire, then the scientist uses Spotfire tools to explore the data and to identify compounds of interest. Follow the steps below for more information on how to connect to Spotfire from ChemBioViz.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Log in to ChemBioViz</li>
            <li>Run a query over a particular form </li>
            <li>The resulting hit list displays in ChemBioViz, and as explained previously, records may be viewed in Form view or in Table view</li>
            <li>In the ChemBioViz menu, select Connect option from the Spotfire menu</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/ChemBioViz images/connect spotfire.gif" />
        </p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>The Spotfire initialization dialog displays and a red arrow gets displayed at the left side of the Spotfire menu meaning that Spotfire is connecting</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/ChemBioViz images/spotfire connecting.gif" />
        </p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Spotfire log in dialog displays, enter the username, password and server path and click on login button</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/ChemBioViz images/spotfire login.gif" />
        </p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Data is loaded, Spotfire is connected and displayed and a green arrow gets displayed at the left side of the Spotfire menu meaning that Spotfire is connected and synchronized with ChemBioViz</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/ChemBioViz images/spotfire connected.gif" />
        </p>
        <p><b>Notes:</b>
        </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>When the arrow becomes gray, it means that Spotfire is connected but not synchronized with ChemBioViz.</li>
            <li>If No arrow is displayed, it means that Spotfire is not connected.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following operations in ChemBioViz are mirrored in Spotfire in real time: when the scientist navigates to a record in a hit list by selection in a table grid, navigates to a record in a hitlist in form view, selects multiple rows in a ChemBioViz table grid or selects multiple cards in a ChemBioViz card view same changes and selection are mirrored in Spotfire.</p>
        <p>The following operations in Spotfire are mirrored in ChemBioViz in real time: when the scientist selects a point in a Spotfire plot, selects a row in a Spotfire table, selects multiple rows in a Spotfire table or selects multiple points in a Spotfire plot same selections are mirrored in ChemBioViz.</p>
