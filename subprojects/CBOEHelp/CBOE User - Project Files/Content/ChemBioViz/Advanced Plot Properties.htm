        <h1>Advanced Plot Properties</h1>
        <p>For advanced users, ChemBioViz offers several options for customizing plots. You must have privileges to edit forms to use these options.
</p>
        <p>All the advanced plot properties are in the form editor Properties window. To open the Properties window
 </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the form editor and select a plot. 
 </li>
            <li>Go to View&gt;Properties.  

</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Refer to the Chart and Misc sections for chart properties you can modify.
</p>
        <p><b>Chart
</b>
        </p>
        <p>The options you can modify are categorized (based on plot features) into collections. To modify a plot, select a collection item and click <img src="../Resources/Images/ChemBioViz images/8_2_24x23.jpg" /> to open the collection editor.
</p>
        <p>A complete description of all the collection options is beyond the scope of this document. However, of particular interest are these areas:
</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">ChartAreas collection
</p>
        <p>A CBVN plot has one chart area, which has appearance properties such as border and background color. The chart area contains a collection of Axis objects, of which CBVN uses the first two, X Axis and Y (Value) Axis. Each of these has a set of properties including grid and tick settings, labels, scale.
</p>
        <p>For plots with a 3D look, use settings in the 3D section of the chart area dialog. Under “Area3DStyle” is a switch “(Enable3D)” which must be set to true if you want a 3D look. Other properties in this section let you adjust perspective, rotation, point of view, etc. Note that most plots displayed in 3D lose most of their interactivity -- you cannot click or highlight points in most 3D views.

</i>
        </p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Series Collection 
</p>
        <p>A CBVN plot has one series, which defines and contains the data points. Series properties include chart type, marker style, and several other properties which can be handled through the Plot Settings dialog. The Data Source values in the series properties show the X and Y fields, but this is not the place to set or change these fields.
</p>
        <p><b>Misc </b>
        </p>
        <p>This section of the properties grid shows CBVN-specific plot properties. These are the same properties as are exposed in the Plot Settings dialog, so they may but need not be set in the properties grid.
