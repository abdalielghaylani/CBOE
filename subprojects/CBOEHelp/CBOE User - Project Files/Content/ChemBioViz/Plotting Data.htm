        <h1>Plotting Data</h1>
        <p>A plot is a graphical representation of selected numeric data over a set of records. Plots are useful for spotting trends in data, identifying outlying data, or just summarizing a lot of numbers in a visually meaningful way. Plots come in many styles and designs, can be easily modified, and provide convenient ways to manage the underlying data.
</p>

        </p>
        <p>A form showing two plots. A) A subform 2D plot (S vs. POC from subtable); B) A standard 1D plot (molecular weight vs. record number).
</p>
        <p>You can place one or more plots on a form. Plots can have any size, shape, or border. They can also be anchored and placed in any location within a form. Unlike other form elements, a plot can be connected to more than one field at a time, and can show data from more than one record at a time. 
</p>
        <p>A typical use for a plot element is to display a two-dimensional scatter plot showing values of one field on the X-axis vs. another field on the Y-axis. Each point represents one record in the current hitlist. The number of points is roughly equal to the size of the hitlist, with these exceptions:
</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>There are no points for records that have missing values.
</li>
            <li>Points that you filter out do not appear (Please refer to "<b style="font-weight: normal;color: #000000;"><a href="Filters.htm">Filters</a></b>").
</li>
            <li>There is a limit to how many points you can plot (1000 points by default).</li>
        </ul>
