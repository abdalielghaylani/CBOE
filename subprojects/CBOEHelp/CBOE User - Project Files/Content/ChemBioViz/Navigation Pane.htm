        <h1>Navigation Pane</h1>
        <p>The navigation pane displays the main functions you use to manage forms and perform queries. You select the dataview to search, queries you have run, and the form or table in which to view your search results.

        <p><b>Dataviews
</b>
        </p>
        <p>A dataview is a list of databases and tables that are available on a particular server. A dataview may not include all data on the server. The ChemBioViz administrator decides which databases and tables to make available. To list the database tables you can search, select Dataviews in the navigation pane.
</p>

        </p>
        <p>An example of the dataview panel. A) a dataview; B) a parent table; C) a child table.

</p>
        <p>You can select only one dataview at a time. To modify the dataviews list, contact the ChemBioViz administrator.
</p>
        <p>Some dataviews may contain child tables that contain data related to a record in another table. For example the database may contain a record for barium chloride that includes its molecular weight and CAS number. The record can include a child table that displays a list of vendors and contact information where to purchase barium chloride. In turn, each vendor record may have a child table of its own (a grandchild table) that lists all the packages ( with their sizes, prices, etc.) in which the vendor sells barium chloride. As you navigate through the parent table, the child and grandchild tables are updated with each new set of data. As you navigate through the child table, the grandchild table is updated while the parent table remains on the same record.</p>
        <p><b>Queries
</b>
        </p>
        <p>This lists all the queries that you have run on the selected dataview. You can select any query on this list to run it again, open hitlists to review them, or combine hitlists from multiple queries. For more information, see "<b style="font-weight: normal;color: #000000;"><a href="Queries.htm">Queries</a></b>". </p>
        <p><b>Forms
</b>
        </p>
        <p>Select a form from either Public Forms (Forms that are visible by everyone) or My Forms (Forms that are visible by the logged in user). After you open a form, you can create queries and view your data. To edit a form, select Edit Form Tab. For more information please refer to "<b style="font-weight: normal;color: #000000;"><a href="Forms.htm">Forms</a></b>".
</p>
        <p><b>Plot Control</b>
        </p>
        <p>Select the Plot Control tab in order to manage the plot axis display.  </p>
