        <h1>Forms</h1>
        <p>Most people are used to viewing data in a table. A table displays each database record in a row and each column displays a field that is the same for all records listed in the table. In ChemBioViz, you are not limited to rows and columns; you can arrange your data any way you want using forms. Forms let you view only the fields you want, arrange and group the fields, resize them, and even colorize them.
</p>
        <p>For every form, the following three default tabs are generated: Form, Table and Query.</p>

        </p>
        <p>The two figures below illustrate how a form may be used to display data.</p>
        <p> "<b>Records displayed in a table</b>" displays all records in a table view as shown in the screen shot below:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/ChemBioViz images/table view.gif" />
        </p>
        <p>"<b>Record displayed in a form</b>" displays the same records in a custom form that displays the child table separated from the parent table data. The parent table data is stacked vertically so that you can quickly scan the information as you browse through records. After you have found the record you want, you can examine the data in the child table for more information. The form may also be modified to show different field arrangements, add or remove fields, or change their appearance.
</p>
        <p>

        <p>A table can display several records at once; whereas, a form typically displays only one record at a time. The fields in the form are automatically updated as you browse through your database (or query results). In ChemBioViz, there are two types of forms: Public forms and Private forms. The form type is defined by where the form is stored and which ChemBioViz users can access it.
