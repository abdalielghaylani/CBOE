        <h1>Push to Registration</h1>
        <p>Push to Registration allows users to pick a sample structure from the Samples section and launches a registration form that gathers up the information on the registration form and attempts to submit and register a compound from E-Notebook. Upon successful registration, a TempID will be returned to the sample properties table.
</p>
        <p>To Register a Sample:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>After creating samples under Reaction section and 
assigning products to it, a Samples section is created automatically</li>
            <li>Under Samples section, each sample displays in a separate sub-section named by its corresponding sample ID</li>
            <li>To register a sample, fill in the sample details you want and click on Push to Registration form tool</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Reg 1104 images/push to registration.gif" />
        </p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>A temp ID&#160;is automatically generated and the Registration application launches showing the submit component window</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Reg 1104 images/submit component form.gif" />
        </p>
        <p>Note: In our example, the logged in user has Registrar privileges, that's why the Register button is available. In the normal workflow, a user with submitter role submits a compound to the temporary table and then a Registrar reviews the submitted records approves and registers them.</p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>If you are logged in with submitter privileges, click on submit button to send the records to the temporary table and then the registrar registers</li>
            <li>If you are logged in with Registrar privileges, click on Register button to directly register and send the records to the permanent table</li>
            <li>Once the compound is registered, go to E-Notebook and click on Fetch Register Number form tool. <br /><i>The Fetch Register Number allows users to query the database with a registration Temp ID. If a Registration Number is available then the Registration Number and Batch Number will be returned to the associated row in the Properties table of the ‘Samples’ section. This method was created to support temporary registration from E-Notebook. For example, Users would register a compound in the temporary tables from E-Notebook and a TempID would be returned to the properties Table. Later a Registrar would then permanently register the compound into the Registration System. Subsequently, the E-Notebook User can Use the Fetch Register Number method to query the Registration Number and Batch number, retuning them to the associated row in the Properties table.</i></li>
            <li>
                <p>If the TempID is present in the Properties table and the Registration Number is available in the registration system then, Fetch Register Number dialog appears displaying the Registration Number and Batch Number</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Reg 1104 images/fetch reg number.gif" />
        </p>
        <p>In case the TempID is present in the Properties Table and the Registration Number is unavailable in the registration system then the following message box displays:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Reg 1104 images/no reg nbr.gif" />
        </p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Click on OK&#160;button. The Registration Number and Batch Number will returned to the associated row in the Properties Table of the ‘Samples’ section.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Reg 1104 images/Reg batch nbrs.gif" />
        </p>
        <p>If the Reg Number and Batch Number fields are already populated with data then the following message box displays:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Reg 1104 images/re-fetch nbr.gif" />
        </p>
        <p>Note: the Temp ID&#160;and the Reg Number will be automatically populated in the Samples table under Reaction section.</p>
