        <h1>Vendor Participation</h1>
        <p>PerkinElmer continually updates its catalogs of suppliers for ChemACX. Therefore, the supplier you want might be in the next release of ChemACX or in the PerkinElmer subscription service, ChemACX.com.</p>
        <p>However, you can also ask your favorite supplier to participate in ChemACX so that you can find your favorite supplier in the next release of ChemACX. To participate, the supplier must send its product list to PerkinElmer. The preferred format for sending the product list is a ChemBioFinder database containing structure details of the products. Other electronic formats, such as Access databases and Excel spreadsheets can also be used for sending the product list. If the product list is small in size, it can be sent in the form of brochure. The supplier can either e-mail the product list to csinfo@cambridgesoft.com or send it to the following address: ChemACX Data, CambridgeSoft Corporation, 100 CambridgePark Drive, Cambridge, MA 02140 (USA).</p>
