        <h1>Fetch Register Number</h1>
        <p>The Fetch Register Number allows users to query the database with a registration Temp ID. If a Registration Number is available then the Registration Number and Batch Number will returned to the associated row in the Products Table of the <b>Reaction</b> section. This method was created to support temporary registration from E-Notebook. For example, users would register a compound in the temporary table from E-Notebook and a TempID would be returned to the Products table. Later a Registrar would then permanently register the compound into the Registration system. Subsequently, the E-Notebook user can use the Fetch Register Number method to query the Registration number and Batch number, retuning them to the associated row in the Products table.

</p>
        <p>Note: user requires adequate Registry permissions to perform this Registry action.</p>
