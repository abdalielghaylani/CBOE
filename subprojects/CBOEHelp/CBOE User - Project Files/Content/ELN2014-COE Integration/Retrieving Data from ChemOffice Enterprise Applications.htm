        <h1>Retrieving Data from ChemOffice Enterprise Applications</h1>
        <p>With E-Notebook - COE integration feature, you can search Inventory, Registry and ChemACX systems and select compounds to add to reaction drawings in E-Notebook. In addition to adding the structure to the reaction drawing, other data associated with the structure may be added to the Reactants or Products table of the section.  

</p>
        <p>The Reaction toolbar Add-ins are configured on the Reaction toolbar field of the standard E-Notebook Reaction section and are launched from the <b>Add</b> button.</p>

        </p>
        <p>The add-in form contains three tabs: Search, Results, and Hit Lists.</p>
        <p><b>Search tab</b>: Enter search criteria to initiate a search. The search form consists of a ChemDraw control to render structures for exact and substructure searching.  A <b>Clear</b> button is available for clearing the form. The <b>Search</b> button executes the search.  A set of text fields are available for entering textual search data.</p>
        <p><b>Results tab</b>: Displays the search results and consists of three grid controls and a ChemDraw control for displaying chemical structures.  The grid controls include a compound grid, a container (or batch grid for registration), and a properties grid. Click on a row in the compound grid and the corresponding chemical structure displays in the ChemDraw control. All associated containers (or batches for registration) display in the container grid. When a row in the container grid is selected, the properties display in the properties grid in a list format for easy viewing. You can add the compound to the underlying Reaction section.</p>
        <p><b>Hit Lists tab</b>: Retrieves data from named hit lists previously saved to the Inventory database. This lets you perform and save complicated searches from the Inventory system, save the results as a hit list and access that hit list in E-Notebook via the Add-in. The available hit lists consist of the authenticated user’s private hit lists and all public hit lists. Perform searches from the “Substructure Search” tab within the Webserver Inventory. </p>
        <p><b>Note</b>: Hit lists created by means other than using the “Substructure search” tab are not available in the hit list drop down list.</p>
