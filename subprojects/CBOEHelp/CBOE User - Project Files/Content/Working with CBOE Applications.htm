        <h1>Working with CBOE Applications</h1>
        <p>The ChemBioOffice Enterprise 17.1 suite (CBOE 17.1) allows you to record, manage, and share a wide variety of R&amp;D information. Diverse types of data display on electronic “pages” in E-Notebook, and other applications. You can retrieve information from an extensive set of databases with an easy-to-use Web-based interface.</p>
        <p>This guide provides a detailed explanation of the CBOE 17.1 applications, their use, and functionality. 
</p>
        <p>Please note that NOT all users have the same privileges and access to the CBOE applications. Your access depends upon your company's requirements, your individual role as a user, and the user group(s) you are assigned to. </p>
        <p>To launch a specific application/feature, click on its corresponding icon on the main CBOE Manager page.</p>
        <p>CBOE includes the following applications:</p>
        <p><b>E-Notebook Client:</b> Select <b>Launch E-Notebook</b> to install the E-Notebook Client. E-Notebook facilitates daily record-keeping for scientists. With E-Notebook, makes it possible for users to manage diverse types of data on electronic “pages”. The electronic pages (sections/experiments) make it easy to organize information and streamline your workflow. With E-Notebook; users can manage information about organic syntheses and related items such as stoichiometry calculations, reaction preparations, spectra, analytical methods, notes, and spreadsheets. 
</p>
        <p>Additional E-Notebook Add-ins, for example, BioAssay, Formulations, and so on, facilitate a variety of work flows in these disciplines. The integration between E-Notebook and ChemBioOffice Enterprise lets you:
</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>Add reactants from Inventory, Registration, and ChemACX databases</li>
            <li>Manage and register samples</li>
            <li>Create containers in inventory</li>
            <li>Launch ChemBioOffice applications, such as, Registration and Inventory from E-Notebook via hyperlinks created in the Sample Information and Reaction sections.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For further details on the E-Notebook workflow please refer to the <i>E-Notebook Guide</i>.</p>
        <p><b>Registration Enterprise:</b> Assigns corporate registration number for compounds based on your organizations business rules.
