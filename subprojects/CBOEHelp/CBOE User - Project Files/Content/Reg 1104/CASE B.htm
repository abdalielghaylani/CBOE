        <h1>CASE B</h1>
        <p>When the system has the following system settings:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>SameBatchIdentity(SBI) = True</li>
            <li>EnableFragments = True</li>
            <li>EnableMixtures = False</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If the structure that the user wants to register is already in the Chemical Registration Database, a solving duplicate window will appear.

The only field for checking duplicates is the structure one.
</p>
        <p>When the record to be registered does not have the same fragment list as for its registered duplicate, the following options will be available:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>Cancel: to cancel the registration process</li>
            <li>Duplicate:  to create a new registry record duplicating the compound information. Then the record will be duplicated with the following properties<ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>Unique Reg Number</li><li>Different Component ID</li><li>Same Structure</li><li>Different Structure ID</li></ul></li>
            <li>Use Structure: to create a new Registry Record reusing the same structure ID. If there is a structure change both registry records will be affected. </li>
        </ul>

        </p>
        <p>When the record to be registered has the same fragment list as for its registered duplicate, the following additional option will be available:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>Add Batch: to add a batch to the currently displaying duplicated registry. This will conclude the duplicates resolution process.</li>
        </ul>
