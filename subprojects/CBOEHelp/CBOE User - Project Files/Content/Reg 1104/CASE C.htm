        <h1>CASE C - Working with Multiple Components</h1>
        <p>When the system has the following system settings:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>SBI = N/A </li>
            <li>EnableFragments = False</li>
            <li>EnableMixtures = True</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If the structure that the user wants to register is already in the Chemical Registration Database, a solving duplicate window will appear. The only field for checking duplicates is the structure one.</p>
        <p>There are two levels of solving duplicates for Registry Records with multiple components:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Solving Component Duplicates:</b> For each component we can review a list of duplicates of the specific components. We can decide to use the same Component ID or to create a new Component.</li>
            <li><b>Solving Registry Record Duplicates:</b> Once the components are solved we have to solve registry record duplicates. Only Records with exactly the same components list will appear.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Once the components are solved we have to solve registry record duplicates. Only Records with exactly the same components and fragment list will appear.</p>
        <p>If the structure that the user wants to register is already in the Chemical Registration Database, a solving duplicate window will appear. The only field for checking duplicates is the structure one.
</p>
        <p>Many cases are provided here: </p>
        <p><b>Note:</b>&#160;in the following cases, Source is the record that the user is registering and Conflict is the record that is already registered in the database.</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li style="font-weight: bold;">Source = Single ; Conflict = Mixture</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;">When the user is registering a component that is duplicated in a Mixture. The following duplicate resolution options will be available:</p>

        <blockquote>
            <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                <li>Cancel: to cancel the registration process</li>
                <li>Duplicate:  to create a new registry record duplicating the compound information. Then the record will be duplicated with the following properties:<ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>Unique Reg Number</li><li>Different Component ID</li><li>Same Structure</li><li>Different Structure ID</li></ul></li>
                <li>Use Component: to use the same Component ID. No component is created.</li>
                <li>Use Structure: to create a new Registry Record reusing the same structure ID. If there is a structure change both registry records will be affected.</li>
            </ul>
        </blockquote>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;" MadCap:continue="true">
            <li style="font-weight: bold;"><b>Source = Mixture ; Conflict = Mixture</b>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>When a user is registering a mixture containing two components, and the mixture is entirely duplicated, the following dialog displays:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Reg 1104 images/case c2.gif" />
        </p>
        <p>The two duplicated components should be resolved one by one. Click on "Resolve this Component" link and select the action that you want to perform. The options are:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                <li>Cancel: to cancel the registration process</li>
                <li>Duplicate: to create a new registry record duplicating the compound information. Then the record will be duplicated with the following properties:<ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>Unique Reg Number</li><li>Different Component ID</li><li>Same Structure</li><li>Different Structure ID</li></ul></li>
                <li>Use Component:  to use the same Component ID. No component is created.</li>
                <li>Use Structure: to create a new Registry Record reusing the same structure ID. If there is a structure change both registry records will be affected</li>
            </ul>

        <p>When the components are resolved, the Duplicate Registry dialog displays:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Reg 1104 images/duplciate registry.gif" />
        </p>
        <p>Select one of the following options to resolve the registry duplicate:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li>Cancel: to cancel the registration process</li>
            <li>Add Batch: to add a batch to the currently displaying duplicated registry. This will conclude the duplicates resolution process.</li>
            <li>Duplicate: to create a new registry record duplicating the compound information. Then the record will be duplicated with the following properties:<ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>Unique Reg Number</li><li>Different Component ID</li><li>Same Structure</li></ul><ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>Different Structure ID</li></ul></li>
        </ul>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;" MadCap:continue="true">
            <li style="font-weight: bold;"><b>Source: Mixture ; Conflict: Single</b>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>When the user is registering a mixture containing a component that is duplicated in a registered record having a single component, the following dialog displays.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Reg 1104 images/case c4.gif" />
        </p>
        <p>Click on resolve this component, the following options shown in the screenshot below will be available:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>Cancel: to cancel the registration process</li>
            <li>Duplicate: to create a new registry record duplicating the compound information. Then the record will be duplicated with the following properties:<ul style="list-style-type: circle;"><li>Unique Reg Number</li><li>Different Component ID</li><li>Same Structure</li></ul><ul style="list-style-type: circle;"><li>Different Structure ID</li></ul></li>
