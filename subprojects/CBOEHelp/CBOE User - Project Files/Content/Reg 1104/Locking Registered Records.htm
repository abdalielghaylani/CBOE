        <h1>Locking Registered Records</h1>
        <p>Users with specific privileges can lock permanent records. Locked registry records cannot be edited, however adding batches and adding identifiers is allowed.</p>
        <p>In order to enable the Locking feature, you need to set "EnableLocked=True"</p>
        <p>Locking requires the following privilege: <b>set_locked_flag</b></p>
        <p>Revoking Locking requires the following privilege: <b>toggle_locked_flag</b></p>
        <p>To lock a registered record:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Log in to ChemBioOffice Enterprise </li>
            <li>Click on Search Registry button under Registration section. The Search form displays. Enter specific criteria to search for specific records or click on <b>Retrieve All</b> button to display all the registered records. The following results window displays</li>

        </p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>The locked column shows the status of the record, when the Thumb is up this means that the record is locked and when the Thumb is down this means that the record is unlocked. Note that you can filter the registered records by their status. You can then display all the unlocked records only.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
