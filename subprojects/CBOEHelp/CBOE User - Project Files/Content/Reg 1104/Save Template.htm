        <h1>Save Template</h1>
        <p>Users can save the record as a draft for later use. For example, if a user is waiting for analytical information to determine the purity of a component that he/she wants to submit and has filled in all other fields in the form. The user can save the form and add the information when it is available.</p>
        <p>To save a record as template:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the submit form and enter the Registry Data.</li>
            <li>Go to <b>Submission Templates</b> and then select "<b>Save Template</b>" option.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>

        </p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Enter the Form Name and Description </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Reg 1104 images/Save Template2.gif" />
        </p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Check the Public Template checkbox if desired, in order to make the record available to other users.</li>
            <li>Click on Save Template button. The Template is saved.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>Note:</b> when Row Level Security (RLS) is set the True by the administrator, you should save the template as Private.</p>
        <p>Row Level Security (RLS), when set to True, prevents certain users from accessing individual database rows based on their security clearance. Row level security is applied based on associations between users, projects, and registered compounds. A user will only see those registered compounds that are associated with projects to which he or she has been granted permissions.</p>
