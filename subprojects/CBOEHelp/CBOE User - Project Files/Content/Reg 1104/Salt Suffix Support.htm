        <h1>Salt Suffix Support</h1>
        <p>This topic covers the Salt Suffix support in Registration.</p>
        <p>If your registration system has the following settings: EnableFragments=True and SameBatchesIdentify=False, the salt suffix feature will be supported. When a user submits a record to which a salt is associated, the salt suffix type will be included in the Full Registry Number. To apply this, please perform the steps below:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Log in to ChemBioOffice Enterprise Manager, click "Main Menu" under Registration Enterprise. The Registrations' home page appears.</li>
            <li>Click <b>Submit New Component</b> icon in the Registration home page  or in the ChemBioOffice Manager home page under Registration Enterprise. The <span class="Action_Object">Submit Component</span> page appears.</li>
            <li>Fill in the fields with specific data.</li>
            <li>Select the Prefix and then add a salt in the Fragment Information table.</li>
            <li>Click Submit, to save the record in the Temporary table.</li>
            <li>If you have adequate privileges, click Approve and then Register to Register the record in the Permanent table, or wait for the Reviewer/Registrar to Approve/Register the record.</li>
            <li>After the record is registered, the newly added salt formula (In this case the Salt Suffix Type was set to Formulae, three other options may be selected: Codes, IDs or Descriptions) will be displayed in the Full Registry Number as shown in the screen shot below:</li>
        </ol>
