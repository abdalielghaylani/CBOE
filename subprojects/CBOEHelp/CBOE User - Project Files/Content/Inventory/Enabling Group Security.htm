            <li>The location for which they have the ownership (or their group has ownership)</li>
            <li>The public locations</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The fulfillers can fill the request to:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li> The requested location (even if they are not part of the ownership group) OR </li>
            <li>Any location for which they have ownership (or their group has ownership) OR </li>
            <li>A public location</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Moving Containers between Groups</b>
        </p>
        <p>While moving the container between Groups the workflow will be as follows:</p>
        <p style="text-decoration: underline;">Scenario:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>User A is a member of Group A. Group A is the location admin of  Location A. There is a container Container A in Location A owned by Group A.</li>
            <li>User B is a member of Group B. Group B is location admin of  Location B.</li>
            <li>User C is a member of Group C. Group C is location admin of  Location C.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="text-decoration: underline;">Use case:</p>
        <p>User B needs the container A from Location A.</p>
        <p style="text-decoration: underline;">Workflow:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>User A will move the container A to a public Location. Here container can be accessed and modified by anyone (UserA, UserB, UserC).</li>
            <li>User B will move the container A to Location B, still the owner is Group A, any member of Group B ( owner of Location B) can modify anything on the container A. Group A users can also edit it here. That’s means containers can be modified by Containers Admins as well as Location Admins. Here User C cannot make edits to the container A.</li>
        </ol>
