        <h1>Inventory Terminology</h1>
        <p><b>Location</b>: Refers to a physical location, such as shelf, or refrigerator, where containers, or plates containing reagents are stored. Locations can be nested within other locations to form a hierarchical structure, as shown in the example below.
</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Inventory images/location_tree_frame.gif" />
        </p>
        <p>The hierarchical structure shown in the preceding example is called the location tree. The folders displayed in the location tree represent physical locations. You can access the desired location by navigating through the various folders in the location tree.

</p>
        <p>For a complete list of location fields, refer to <b style="color: #ff0000;"><b style="font-weight: normal;color: #000000;"><a href="Inventory Enterprise Form Fields.htm">Inventory Enterprise Form Fields</a></b></b>.

</p>
        <p><i><b>Note:</b>   The Inventory Application supports only English characters for location, container, and substance names.
</i>
        </p>
        <p><b>Container</b>: Refers to a physical entity that can store the chemical substances. You can create different types of containers in Inventory Enterprise, such as tube, bottle, box, vial, and cylinder. Unlike physical containers, you can associate only single primary chemical substances with an Inventory container. You can associate secondary chemical substances, such as a solvent, with the container using the additional container fields. For a complete list of container fields, refer to <b style="font-weight: normal;color: #000000;"><a href="Inventory Enterprise Form Fields.htm">Inventory Enterprise Form Fields</a></b>.

</p>
        <p>You can associate Registration Enterprise, or ChemACX substances, with the Inventory containers, if Inventory Enterprise is integrated with Registration Enterprise or ChemACX applications.
</p>
        <p><b>Substance</b>: Refers to a single and pure chemical compound that can be used by the chemical and pharmaceutical research centers in their experiments and research. In Inventory Enterprise, the chemical structure of a substance is represented by a two-dimensional drawing. 

</p>
        <p>Inventory Enterprise helps the chemical and pharmaceutical research centers maintain and manage substances. 

</p>
        <p>Inventory Enterprise stores the substances in its own database. It also ensures that a substance is not duplicated, and is stored only once. This is achieved by ensuring that the unique fields, such as, name and chemical structure of the substance are not duplicated. </p>
        <p>For a complete list of substance fields, refer to <b style="color: #ff0000;"><b style="font-weight: normal;color: #000000;"><a href="Inventory Enterprise Form Fields.htm">Inventory Enterprise Form Fields</a></b></b>.
