        <h1>Reports Management</h1>
        <p>The Reports sub-module of the Inventory Enterprise application enables you to create reports, which can be used to gather information about the locations, containers, and substances in Inventory Enterprise. The data required for creating reports is stored in the ReportQueue.mdb and ChemInv_reports.mdb tables. Inventory Enterprise uses the ReportsQ.dll and Reports.exe files to manage reports.

</p>
        <p style="font-style: italic;"><b>Note:</b>   You should create the schemas, CHEMINVDB2 and REGDB in the same Oracle database otherwise the default queries for Inventory reports will not work and you will have to reconfigure those queries.
</p>
        <p>In Inventory Enterprise, there are two types of reports:

 </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>Standard reports: Refer to the reports that are already available in Inventory Enterprise. 
 </li>
            <li> Custom reports: Refer to the reports that are not already available in Inventory Enterprise and are created by the users, as per their requirements. 

</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Both types of reports are driven by the report layouts, which specifies the format of a report and the information that is to be included in the report.
