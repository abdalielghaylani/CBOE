        <h1>Hazards and Precautions</h1>
        <p><b>Hazards</b>
        </p>
        <p>All chemicals have corresponding symbols indicating possible hazards with this chemical. Chemicals are grouped according to the types hazards they pose. For example:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>C: Corrosive</li>
            <li>E: Explosive</li>
            <li>F: Highly Flammable</li>
            <li>F+: Extremely Flammable</li>
            <li>N: Dangerous for the Environment</li>
            <li>O: Oxidizing Material</li>
            <li>T: Carcinogenic</li>
            <li>T+: Very Toxic</li>
            <li>Xi: Irritant</li>
            <li>Xn: Harmful</li>
        </ul>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p><b>Risk Sentences or R Sentences</b>
        </p>
        <p>R Sentences are the special risks attributed to dangerous substances and preparations.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p><b>Safety Sentences or S Sentences</b>
        </p>
        <p>S Sentences are the safety advice for dangerous substances and preparations.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p><b>GHS Hazard</b>
        </p>
        <p>The GHS is an acronym for the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals. The GHS is a system for standardizing and harmonizing the classification and labelling of chemicals. It is a logical and comprehensive approach to: 
</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>Defining health, physical and environmental hazards of chemicals; 
</li>
            <li>Creating classification processes that use available data on chemicals for comparison with the defined hazard criteria; and </li>
            <li>Communicating hazard information, as well as protective measures, on labels and Safety Data Sheets (SDS)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Inventory images/GHS Hazard.gif" />
        </p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">H Hazard Sentences</p>
        <p>Hazard statements form part of the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS). They form a set of standardized phrases about the hazards of chemical substances and mixtures that can be translated into different languages. As such, they serve the same purpose as the well-known R-phrases, which they replace.</p>
        <p>H Hazard Sentences includes:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>Physical Hazards</li>
            <li>Health Hazards</li>
            <li>Environmental Hazards</li>
            <li>European Union Specific Hazard Statements (EUH-sentences)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Inventory images/H hazard sentences.gif" />
        </p>
        <p><b>Precautionary Sentences</b>
        </p>
        <p>Precautionary statements form part of the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS). They form a set of standardized phrases giving advice about the correct handling of chemical substances and mixtures, which are translated into different languages. As such, they serve the same purpose as the well-known S-phrases, which they are intended to replace.</p>
