 </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">

            <li>Container search result report 
 </li>
            <li>Location report </li>
            <li> Custom report </li>
            <li>Plate location report </li>

            <li>Plate label report

        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Label Report
</p>
        <p>Label reports allow you to generate barcode for a container. Container barcode is a special type of report that lets you gather information about all the attributes of the container. You can generate barcode for a container by navigating to the desired container in the Container List frame and clicking the Print Label link in the Container Details frame.

        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Location Report
</p>
        <p>Location reports can be used either to gather information about all the containers stored in a location or to generate barcodes for all the containers.

You can generate a location report by navigating to the required location in the location tree frame and clicking the Print Report link in the Container List frame.
