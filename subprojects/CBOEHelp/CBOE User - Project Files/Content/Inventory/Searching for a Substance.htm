        <h1><a name="top"></a>Searching for a Substance</h1>
        <p>You can search for substances in Inventory Enterprise using the search form displayed in the Substance Management area of Inventory Enterprise. 

</p>
        <p>The Substance Management area is accessed by clicking the <b>Manage Substances</b> link in the Inventory Enterprise section of the ChemBioOffice Enterprise home page. 

</p>
        <p>The search form  in Substance Management is a simplified version of the Substructure Search tab window. It lets you search Inventory Enterprise on the basis of the Substructure, Substance Name, CAS Registry #, ACX Number, Molecular Formula, MolWeight Range, Compound ID, and Compound Type fields.

</p>
        <p>The following is an example of the search form.
</p>

        <p><i><b>Note:</b>   You can also access a substance search form through the Substance tab window of the Create or Edit an Inventory Container window, which displays when you click the New Container link in the Current Location frame. This search form is used when you need to search a substance to add to a container. For more information about searching a substance through the Substance tab window,  see "<b style="font-weight: normal;color: #000000;">Substance Tab</b>" under <a href="Creating a New Container.htm">Creating a New Container</a>.
