        <h1>Viewing Contents of a Plate</h1>
        <p>After searching a plate either by navigating through the location tree frame or using the Plate Search tab, you can view the contents of the plate using the two frames of the Container Management area which are:

 </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>Plate List frame 
 </li>
            <li>Plate Details frame 

</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Plate List Frame
</p>
        <p>The Plate List frame displays all the plates and containers contained in the selected location. The icons beside each plate enable you to distinguish the plates from the containers. The following figure displays the Plate List frame:
</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Inventory images/plate_list_frame.gif" />
        </p>
        <p>The Plate List frame consists of various columns that allow you to gather information about the key plate attributes, such as plate type and format. You can click a column to sort the plates displayed in the Plate List frame on the basis of the column. When you click a column, the following icon <img src="../Resources/Images/Inventory images/sort_icon.gif" /> is displayed next to the column name. This icon enables you to determine the sorting order for the plates.

</p>
        <p>The Plate List frame provides several links for displaying the list of plates in different ways. These links are:

 </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li> View menu: Contains the following options: 
 <ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>Multi-Select: allows you to select more than one plate. After selecting multiple plates, you can perform an action on all the plates simultaneously. </li><li> 
 Large Icons: displays large icons corresponding to the list of plates.  
 </li><li> Small Icons: displays small icons corresponding to the list of plates. </li><li> 
 Details: displays the Plate List frame in its default view, along with the plate details. </li><li> 
  Column Chooser: lets you customize the appearance of the plate list frame. You can use the Column Chooser link to add or remove columns to or from the plate list frame and set the width of the columns. You can also use Column Chooser to specify the number of plates that should be displayed in a window of the plate list frame, at once. </li></ul></li>
            <li> 
 Update Contents: verifies whether a plate is at the appropriate location. The Update Contents link does not allow you to update Inventory Enterprise.  
 </li>
            <li>Rectify Contents: Verifies whether a plate is at the appropriate location. The Rectify Contents link also lets you update Inventory Enterprise.  
 </li>
            <li> Print Report: Lets you generate reports containing information about all the plates displayed in the plate list frame.  

</li>
        </ul>
        <p><i><b>Note:</b>   The Update Contents link is not displayed in the plate list frame if you do not have appropriate privileges to update the location's contents. For information about whether you have privileges to update the contents of a location or not, see "<b style="font-weight: normal;color: #000000;"><a href="Roles.htm">Roles</a></b>" and "<a href="Privileges.htm">Privileges</a>".</i>
        </p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Plate Details Frame
</p>
        <p>The Plate Details frame displays detailed information about the plate selected in the Plate List frame. The following figure displays the Plate Details frame:
</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Inventory images/plate_details_frame.gif" />
        </p>

</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Inventory images/plate_list_frame.gif" />

</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Plates Per Window

</p>
        <p>By default, a window of the Plate List frame can display 100 plates at a time. However, you can change the default setting by editing the value in the Plates per page text box displayed in the above window. 

</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Column Width

            <li>Set the width of the columns, as required, and click the Save button. 

</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Update Contents
</p>
        <p>There are situations where the locations of the plates are changed, but Inventory Enterprise is not updated with the changes. This results in discrepancies in Inventory Enterprise. The update content feature of Inventory Enterprise lets you check for these discrepancies and verify whether a plate is at the location where it should be. </p>
        <p>However, unlike the Content Rectification feature, the update contents feature does not allow you to correct these discrepancies. It lets you move the plates to their corresponding location where they should be. However, it does not allow you to move the plates existing in the wrong location to the missing location.

</p>
        <p>To update the contents of a location:

 </p>
        <ol>
            <li> In the location tree, select the location to which you want to update the content. 
 </li>
            <li>Click the Update Contents link in the Plate List frame. The Reconcile plates at the selected location window appears as: </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Inventory images/plate_updatelocation.gif" />
        </p>
        <p><i><b>Note:</b> The lower frame of the Reconcile Location window contains a list of plates that are expected to be there at the selected location.
</i> <![CDATA[ ]]></p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Type the barcode of the plate, whose availability is to be verified, in the Scan Barcode text box. 
 </li>
            <li>Press the Tab key. 
 </li>
            <li>Observe that if the scanned plate is available at the location, the check box next to the plate, in the list of plates that are expected to be there at the location, gets selected. However, if the scanned plate is not available at the location, the plate is added to the list of the misplaced plates. </li>
            <li>Repeat steps 3 and 4 for all the plates, whose availability is to be verified. </li>
        </ol>
        <p><i><b>Note:</b> Clear the check box next to the misplaced plate, if you do not want to move it to the location, contents of which are being updated.
</i> <![CDATA[ ]]></p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Click OK. 

</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Rectify Contents
</p>
        <p>There are situations when the locations of the plates are changed, but Inventory Enterprise is not updated with the changes. This results in discrepancies in Inventory Enterprise. The content rectification feature of Inventory Enterprise lets you verify that a plate is at the location where it should be. Unlike the Update Content feature, it also lets you correct these discrepancies and update Inventory Enterprise.

</p>
        <p>The content rectification feature should be used on quarterly or biannual basis during official reconciliation efforts. After rectifying the content of a location, you can perform various tasks, which are:
</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>Move the plates that are not present in a location, but should be there, to that location. 
 </li>
            <li>Move the plates that are present in a location, but should not be there, to the Missing location. 

</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To rectify contents:

 </p>
        <ol>
            <li>In the location tree, select the location to which you want to rectify the content.
 </li>
            <li>Click the Rectify Contents link in the Plate List frame. The Reconcile Location window appears. 

</li>
        </ol>
        <p><i><b>Note:</b>The lower frame of the Reconcile Location window contains a list of plates that are expected to be there in the selected location.
</i> <![CDATA[ ]]></p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li> Type the barcode of the plate, whose availability is to be verified, in the Scan Barcode text box. 
 </li>
            <li>Press the Tab key. </li>
            <li> Observe that if the scanned plate is available in the location, the check box next to the plate, in the list of plates that are expected to be there at the location, gets selected. However, if the scanned plate is not available in the location, the plate is added to the list of the misplaced plates. 
 </li>
            <li>Repeat steps 3 and 4 for all the plates, whose availability is to be verified. 

</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="font-style: italic;"><b>Note:</b> Clear the check box next to the misplaced plate, if you do not want to move it to the locations contents of which are being rectified.
 </p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Click OK. If the list of the expected plates contains some plates that are not verified, the plates are marked as missing. 
 </li>
            <li>If the scanned plate is not available in the location, the plate is added to the list of the misplaced plates. The list can be viewed under the Misplaced tab, which appears in the Reconcile Location window when you press the Tab key after scanning a barcode.</li>
            <li>If the scanned barcode does not exist in the Inventory database then it is added to a temporary list of unknown/new plates. This list appears under the New tab and displays the unknown/new plates that have been scanned/entered since the Reconcile Location form was first opened.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Print Report
</p>
        <p>The Print Report link in the Plate List frame lets you generate a report that can provide summarized information about all the plates contained in the Plate List frame. The reports are driven by the report layouts, which specify the format of a report and the information that is to be included in the report. As the reports are driven by the report layouts, the reports may not provide the same information as provided by the Plate List frame. For example, the Plate List frame may display information about the plate concentration. However, the report generated for the Plate List frame may not provide this information.
</p>
        <p><i><b>Note:</b>   If the reports available in Inventory Enterprise do not fulfill your requirements and you need additional reports, see your system administrator.
</i>
        </p>
        <p>To generate reports using the Print Report link:

 </p>
        <ol>
            <li> Click the Print Report link in the Plate List frame. The Reports window is displayed. 
 </li>
            <li>Select the appropriate report layout from the Select a report layout drop down list. 
 </li>
            <li>Click the Go button. The Reports window gets populated with the Select a report format drop down list. 
 </li>
            <li> Select the appropriate format for the report from the Select a report format drop down list. 
 </li>
            <li>Click the Go button. A warning message is displayed. The warning message informs you that the window, which will be displayed next possesses a security risk. 
 </li>
            <li>Click the Yes button to continue. The report for the selected location appears as:</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Inventory images/plate_viewing_report.gif" />
        </p>
        <p>You can print the reports by clicking the <img src="../Resources/Images/Inventory images/print_icon.gif" /> icon displayed in the lower frame of the Reports window.

        <p>The Retire Plate link lets you retire a plate, but reserve the contents of the plate. When you retire a plate, the plate is moved to the Disposed location and the status of the plate is set to Tested. Retiring is different than deleting because when a plate is retired its content is preserved, but when it is deleted, its content is lost permanently.

        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Create Daughter Plates
</p>
        <p>You can create daughter plates from a plate, only if the parent plate contains enough content. When creating daughter plates, reformatting plates, or creating plates from text file, you need to take in consideration the following values: 

 </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>The quantity of the compound </li>
            <li> 
  The volume/concentration of the solution. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you are tracking the quantity of compound and the volume/concentration of a solution then you should have values for qty_remaining and solvent_volume fields. Solution_volume will be calculated from these values. However, concentration will have to be entered by the user. The system will calculate the Molar concentration by default, but that is stored in a separate field. 

</p>
        <p>If you are tracking the volume/concentration of a solution then you can simply enter the solution volume and qty_remaining will be null. You can still add solvent_volume to dilute the plate. 

</p>
        <p>When daughtering/reformatting/creating plates from text file or any time you are creating a new plate from an existing plate, the system should automatically decrement the quantity values appropriately. 

 

</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Examples: 

 </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>Dry compound, solvated

</p>
        <p>The Reformat Plates lets you create a plate that contains compounds of multiple plates. Reformatting plates is similar to creating daughter plates with the exception that reformatted plates can have multiple parents.

</p>
        <p>You can reformat either one, four, or five plates to create a new plate. Reformatting one plate is exactly similar to creating a daughter plate, because the plate created after reformatting has a single parent. The plates are reformatted into a new plate using the reformat map, which specifies the format of the plate created after reformatting. Various default reformat maps can be used to reformat the plates:

 </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>Daughter: Lets you reformat one plate. 
 </li>
            <li>4 96 Well To 1 384 Well Map: Lets you reformat four plates. 
 </li>
            <li>Mix Plate Map: Lets you reformat five plates.  

</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Apart from using default reformat map, you can also create your own reformat map for reformatting plates. However, you can use the custom reformat maps for reformatting only four plates. You can create two types of reformat maps for reformatting plates, which are:

 </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>Stamped reformat map 
 </li>
            <li>Dithered reformat map

</p>
        <p>When you reformat a plate using the Stamped Reformat map, the plate is divided into four equal parts and each part of the plate contains compound of single parent plate. For example, if you reformat P1, P2, P3, and P4 plates using the stamped reformat map, first part of the plate will contain compound of P1, second part will contain compound of P2, third part will contain compound of P3, and fourth part will contain compound of P4. 

</p>
