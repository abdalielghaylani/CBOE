        <h1>Searching for a Plate</h1>
        <p>If you know the plate's location that you are looking for, you can navigate to the plate using the location tree frame of the container management area.

        <p>To search a plate using the Location Tree frame:

 </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Click the Browse link within the Inventory Enterprise section in the ChemBioOffice Enterprise home page. The Container Management area appears. 
 </li>
            <li> In the location tree, navigate to the location that contains the required plate. 
 </li>
            <li>Select the appropriate location. The plates contained in the selected location are displayed in the Plate List frame. </li>
        </ol>

            <li> Click the appropriate plate in the Plate List frame to view its details in the Plate Details frame. 

</li>
        </ol>
        <p>When you do not know the location of the plate that you are looking for, you can search the plate using the search form, which lets you search the plate on the basis of various plate attributes, such as plate name and type. You can access this search form by clicking the Plate Search tab. The Plate Search tab can be accessed by clicking the Search link within the Inventory Enterprise section in the ChemBioOffice Enterprise home page. You can also access the Plate Search tab by clicking the New Search link in the current location frame.
