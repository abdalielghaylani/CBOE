        <h1>Doc Manager Introduction</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the Doc Manager chapter.</p>
        <p>This chapter provides a full description of the DocManager, its features, and complete instructions on how to use them from the non-administrator user point of view.</p>
        <p>DocManager Enterprise is used to create, store and share chemical documents. Using DocManager Enterprise, the user can:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>Store documents at a central location and share them with other users.</li>
            <li>Perform structural and text (exact phrase or word) searching.</li>
            <li>Quickly retrieve large amount of data located throughout stored documents.</li>
            <li>Standardize methods for delivering written information.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With DocManager's user friendly interface, any new user can begin using it instantly. You can create and maintain a secure chemical document repository, add or submit documents over the Web, keep track of relationships between documents, and quickly search and retrieve documents. The documents submitted are stored in the database and all DocManager users with proper privileges can search and view the documents.</p>
        <p>The DocManager search feature lets you find specific information quickly and easily. The search can be based on either chemical structure or the content of the document. It supports basic and advanced document searching techniques. Users with proper privilege can remove documents that are no longer used or shared.</p>
        <p>You can also integrate DocManager Enterprise with other Enterprise applications such as Inventory Enterprise and Registration Enterprise. As a result, you can easily access linked documents through these applications.</p>
        <p><b>Note that this chapter just covers the workflow allowed for non-administrator users which is the Documents searching. </b>
