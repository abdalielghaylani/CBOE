        <h1>Marking Records</h1>
        <p>Marking records lets you view the records without creating a search query for them.</p>
        <p>To mark a record:</p>
        <p>In the <b>Temporary Registration Records</b> table or in the <b>Registration Records</b> table, check the checkbox corresponding to the record that you want to mark.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>The count of marked records appears at the top, in addition to a number of buttons allowing you to perform multiple actions. For example:&#160;Delete the marked records, show the marked records only, save the marked records, approve the marked records, etc...</p>
        <H3>Marking All Records</H3>
        <p>You can mark all the records in the table with a single click. There is a maximum number of records that you are allowed to mark at once. In the default configuration the maximum marked allowed value is set to 500 records.</p>
        <p><b>Note:</b> The Mark All checkbox is enabled if the total record count in the table does not exceed the max marked allowed value, otherwise the checkbox is disabled. The max marked allowed value is set by your system administrator.</p>
        <p>To mark all records, click on the mark all checkbox in the table header.</p>
