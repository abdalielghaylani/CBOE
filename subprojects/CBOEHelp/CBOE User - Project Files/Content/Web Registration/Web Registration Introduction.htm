        <h1>Web Registration Introduction</h1>
        <p>Web Registration provides a friendly user interface allowing users to register their organization's components to a common database. Users can add, search, edit components and batches and share registration records over a network through a simple and user-friendly web interface. Any user can immediately track the records submitted by another user, enabling them to gather information stored in the database easily and quickly.
</p>
        <p>Users can enter data and administrators can manage user accounts using simple Web forms. Registration detects any data entry errors and provides a duplicate resolution process before registering the component in the database.
