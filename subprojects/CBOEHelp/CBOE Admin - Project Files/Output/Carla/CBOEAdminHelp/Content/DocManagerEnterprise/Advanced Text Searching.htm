        <h1>Advanced Text Searching</h1>
        <p>Advanced text Searching narrows the search
and retrieve precise results by the using of specific
operators.
</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Escape Characters
</p>
        <p>To search for words or symbols that have special
meaning to query expressions, such as &amp;
or |, you must escape them so that DocManager
doesn't interpret them as search operators.
There are two ways to escape characters in a
query expression, using the curly brackets,
{}and using a back slash, \.
</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Curly brackets
</p>
        <p>Any symbol or string within a set of curly
brackets is considered a part of the escape
sequence. When you use braces to escape a
single character, the escaped character
becomes a separate token in the query. The
table below shows examples of how to use
curly brackets to escape an ampersand (&amp;) and
a dash (-):</p>
        <table style="width: 100%;">
            <col />
            <col />
            <tbody>

        </table>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">back slash</p>
        <p>The backlash symbol can be used to escape only a single character or a symbol. Only the character/symbol immediately following the back slash is escaped. The table below shows examples of how to use a back slash to escape an ampersand (&amp;) and a dash (-):</p>
        <table style="width: 100%;">

        <p>The various types of advanced text searching are:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li value="1">ABOUT</li>
            <li value="2">AND (&amp;)</li>
            <li value="3">EQUIValence (=)</li>
            <li value="4">fuzzy (?)</li>
            <li value="5">MINUS (-)</li>
            <li value="6">NEAR</li>
            <li value="7">NOT (~)</li>
            <li value="8">OR (|)</li>
            <li value="9">Soundex (!)</li>
            <li value="10">Stem ($)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>ABOUT</p>
        <p>The ABOUT operator, retrieves documents that contain information related to a word or phrase. Therefore, rather than searching for documents that contain specific words or phrases, you can search for documents that are about a certain subject, even if that subject is not mentioned explicitly in the document.</p>
        <p>The ABOUT operator is useful when you have already built a knowledge base. For more information about building a suitable knowledge base for your installation, see the Oracle 9i Text guide.</p>
        <p>The ABOUT operator is used, by entering the word ABOUT in all capital letters followed by the word or phrase on which to search in parentheses.</p>
        <p>Searches using the ABOUT operator are case sensitive. For example, if you had added "carbon" and "carbon bi-products from synthesis at 25 degrees Celsius" to your knowledge base, the following table lists how your searches are interpreted:</p>
        <table style="width: 100%;">
            <col />
            <col />
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td><b>Searching For...</b>
                    </td>
                    <td><b>Returns...</b>
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>ABOUT (carbon)</td>
                    <td>Documents with words
related to carbon in the
document’s text. Matches
include coal and diamond.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>ABOUT (carbon
bi-products from
syntheses at 25
degrees Celsius)</td>
                    <td>Documents with words
related to "carbon bi-products
from synthesis at 25
degrees Celsius".</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>The ABOUT operator becomes more effective when coupled with other operators, such as AND or NOT.</p>
        <p>For example, if you had added "carbon" and "diamond" to your knowledge base, the table lists how your searches are interpreted:</p>
        <table style="width: 100%;">
            <col />
            <col />
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td><b>Searching For...</b>
                    </td>
                    <td><b>Returns...</b>
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>ABOUT
(carbon)
AND
diamond</td>
                    <td>Documents with words related
to carbon as well as the word
diamond.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>ABOUT
(carbon) NOT
ABOUT
(diamond)</td>
                    <td>Documents with words related
to carbon but excluding the
word diamond.</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>NOTE: For advanced Oracle users: The word or phrase specified in an ABOUT query does not have to exactly match the themes stored in the index. Oracle automatically normalizes the word or phrase before performing lookup in the Text index.</p>
        <p><b>AND</b>
        </p>
        <p>The AND (&amp;) operator, retrieves documents that contain more than one word or phrase. The AND operator is used to search for documents that contain all the search items that you specify. For a document to be returned, it must contain at least one instance of each item. The AND operator is used by typing the first term, the word AND or &amp;, followed by another word or phrase.</p>
        <p>Examples of using the AND operator are:</p>
        <table style="width: 100%;">
            <col />
            <col />
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td><b>Searching For...</b>
                    </td>
                    <td><b>Returns...</b>
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>carbon AND
diamond</td>
                    <td>Documents that include at
least one instance of "carbon"
and "diamond".</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>carbon &amp;
diamond</td>
                    <td>Documents that include at
least one instance of "carbon"
and "diamond".</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>carbon &amp;
diamond &amp;
graphite</td>
                    <td>Documents that include at
least one instance of "carbon",
"diamond", and "graphite".</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>thymidine

AND carbon
dioxide</td>
                    <td>Documents that include at
least one instance of "thymidine
synthesis" and "carbon

                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p><b>EQUIValence</b>
        </p>
        <p>The EQUIValence (=) operator, lets you find documents that contain words that are interchangeable or similar. The EQUIValence operator is used to specify an acceptable substitution for a word in a query. The EQUIValence operator is used by writing EQUIV or =, followed by the phrase on which the search is to be performed.</p>
        <p>The following table lists a few examples of using the EQUIValence operator:</p>
        <table style="width: 100%;">
            <col />

                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>graphite
EQUIV
diamond</td>
                    <td>The words graphite or
diamond occurring anywhere
within a document’s text.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>graphite =
diamond</td>
                    <td>The words graphite or
diamond occurring anywhere
within a document’s text.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>carbon dioxide
= monoxide</td>
                    <td>The words carbon dioxide,
carbon monoxide, or both
terms occurring anywhere
within a document’s text.</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>NOTE: The EQUIValent operator has higher precedence than all other operators except the expansion operators, such as fuzzy, soundex, and stem.</p>
        <p><b>NOT</b>
        </p>
        <p>Use the NOT (~) operator to specify two terms so that the search retrieves documents that contain the first term, but not the second term. To use the NOT operator, type the term to be searched followed by either NOT or ~, and the term to be excluded.</p>
        <p>Examples of using the NOT operator:</p>
        <table style="width: 100%;">
            <col />
            <col />

diamond nor graphite.</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>NOTE: The NOT operator does not affect other logical operators.</p>
        <p><b>OR</b>
        </p>
        <p>The OR (|) operator retrieves documents that contain one or more terms (where each term is a word or phrase) that you specify. Type the first term followed by OR or the symbol, |, followed by another term.</p>
