        <h1>Refreshing Tables</h1>
        <p>The Refresh All Tables or Refresh Table button in the Schema Management page lets you view the fields that have been recently added to a schema. Before clicking the Refresh All Tables or Refresh Table button, you need to be aware of the following consequences: 
</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>The fields displayed by this button do not have any column order. Administrators need to make the fields visible and set the column order after refresh.
</li>
            <li>If a field is renamed, a new column is added with the new name. However, the old field remains as-is. Administrators need to set the old field visibility so that it is no longer visible to users.
</li>
            <li>If a field is deleted, the field will remain in BioSAR Enterprise after refreshing. In such cases, administrators need to set the field visibility so that it is no longer visible to users.
</li>
            <li>Clicking this button removes links between schemas and there is no option for cancelling the operations.
</li>
        </ul>
