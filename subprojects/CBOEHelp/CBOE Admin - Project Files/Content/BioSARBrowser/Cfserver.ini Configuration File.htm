        <h1>Cfserver.ini Configuration File</h1>
        <p>The CFServer.ini file is found in the following location: &lt;webroot&gt;/ChemOffice/biosar_browser/config.</p>
        <p>It defines parameters that allow the BioSAR Enterprise application to find necessary information and how to react in certain situations. When editing fields in this file, it is important to be sure what is going to change because many of these settings are necessary for the application to function properly. 
</p>
        <p>The Cfserver.ini file has two sections:
</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>GLOBALS
</li>
            <li>CS_SECURITY
</li>
        </ul>
        <p><i><b>Note:</b> It is the responsibility of a site's administrator to propagate any changes made to ChemOffice Enterprise application files to future versions of the application. New versions of the ChemOffice Enterprise use default configurations.
