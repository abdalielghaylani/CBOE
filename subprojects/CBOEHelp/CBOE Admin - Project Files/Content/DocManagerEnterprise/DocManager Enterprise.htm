        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>Store documents at a central location and
share them with other users.
</li>
            <li>Perform structural and text(exact phrase or

</li>
            <li>Quickly retrieve large amount of data
located throughout stored documents.
</li>
            <li>Standardize methods for delivering written
information.
</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With DocManager's user friendly interface,
any new user can begin using it instantly. You

repository, add or submit documents
over the Web, keep track of relationships
between documents, and quickly search and
retrieve documents. The documents submitted
are stored in the database and all DocManager

view the documents.
</p>
        <p>The DocManager search feature lets you find
