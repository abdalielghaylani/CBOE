        <h1>Error Logging in Web Registration</h1>
        <p>Error logs and application logs are created and saved in the c:\windows\temp\RegServerLogs\ folder in the Server machine. If there are any errors in the application such as application UI crashing, the details of the error will be written into the log file. The log files are typically created on a daily basis and are named in the LOG_YYYYMMDD.log format. The log file will be blank until an error occurs in the application.</p>
