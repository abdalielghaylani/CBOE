        <h1>ChemDraw Chemical Warning Checker</h1>
        <p>The ChemDraw Chemical Warning Checker Add-in checks for  correct chemical syntax of the structure drawn in the structure window. It displays a wavy red box around the questionable object if it finds an error in your structure. It can be configured to check for chemical warnings when the user clicks Submit or Register or both. It also provides you with an option to enable or disable any chemical warning as per your preferences.</p>

        <p>Although the core functionality of ChemDraw Chemical Warning Checker is in Registration Enterprise, it is also supported in DataLoader(classic) and DataLoader2. You can enable or disable ChemDraw Chemical Warning Checker in DataLoader by clicking on Edit Config and making the required changes.</p>
        <p><b>Note:</b> InvLoader is bypassing ChemDraw Chemical Warning Checker in CBOE 18.1 release.</p>
