        <h1>Data Loader Introduction</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the Data Loader chapter.</p>
        <p>Several ChemBioOffice Enterprise applications let you submit records to an Oracle database. Unfortunately, these applications typically let you enter only one record at a time. If you need to import multiple records at a time -- dozens, hundreds, or even thousands -- you will likely want to use Data Loader instead.</p>
        <p>Data Loader lets you load large batches of data into the Registration database. You can also use Data Loader to convert data files into either XML or text format to use in other applications, such as Inventory Enterprise. You can configure Data Loader for one-time data loading or recurring data loading tasks.</p>
        <p>When you are loading bulk data using Data Loader, you can map the bulk data with the desired output format. Data Loader is designed to easily support new output data formats. Therefore, you will not need additional software to represent data in new output formats.</p>
        <p>Data Loader lets you resolve duplicates (matched compounds) before loading any data. In addition, new configuration settings have been created to allow the matching algorithm to use a compound’s custom fields or identifiers in the absence of a true chemical structure. This combination of features provides you with better information for making decisions about the import process.</p>
