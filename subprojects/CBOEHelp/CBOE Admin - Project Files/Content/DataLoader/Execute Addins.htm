        <h1>Execute Addins</h1>
        <p>The Registration System is highly configurable.  It can be extended with Addins that perform additional calculations and validations.  Depending on the number and nature of configured Addins, a significant fraction of the total record load time can be consumed in this step.  It is therefore possible to significantly reduce bulk load times by disabling unnecessary or slow Addins.  This is particularly applicable during legacy data load scenarios, where the incoming data may have already been validated or prepared in the original system and does not significantly benefit from the additional work performed by the Addins.
</p>
        <p>Addins can be disabled via the Customize Registration &gt; Manage Addins &gt; Edit Addin dialog of the Registration web client.  Addins that utilize ChemDraw or ChemScript to perform calculations are amongst the most time consuming.  For very large data loads, it may prove beneficial to disable Addins, such as ChemDraw Calculations, and perform necessary calculations by directly updating database values after the load is completed.
</p>
        <p>The Aggregate Structures Addin is required and cannot be disabled via the Registration web application.  Its job is to generate a chemical drawing with the aggregation of chemical structures for each component in a mixture.  Since existing bulk loading clients do not support mixtures, this addin could be potentially disabled to avoid the cost of preparing and storing an additional copy of the chemical structure.  The only way to disable this Addin is to directly edit the Addin configuration in the REGDB.COEOBJECTCONFIG database table.  If the Aggregate Structure is disabled during the bulk load, then the value of REGDB.MIXTURE. STRUCTUREAGGREGATION column should be updated with the corresponding values from REGDB.VW_COMPOUND.STRUCTURE column.

        <blockquote>
            <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
                <li>Disable the Structure Normalization Addin
</li>
                <li>Disable the Find Custom Duplicates Addin
</li>
                <li>Disable any non-essential custom Addins

</li>

        <blockquote>
            <p>After Bulk Load:
</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
                <li>Re-enable Addins to their pre-load state
 
</li>
            </ul>
        </blockquote>
        <p>For large loads (&gt; 150K records) consider also disabling the Structure Aggregation addin and performing the Batch Formula, Formula Weight, Percent Active, and Autogenerated Chemical Name calculations directly via SQL update.
