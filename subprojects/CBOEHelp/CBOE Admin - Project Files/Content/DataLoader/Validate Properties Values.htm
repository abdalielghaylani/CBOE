        <h1>Validate Properties Values</h1>
        <p>After reading the data file the client validates all custom property data values against the conditions defined in the system configuration.  This process is performed as each record is read from file.  It does not consume significant time and does not require any optimizations.  There is little to be gained removing or simplifying validation rules.</p>
