        <h1>Loading Substances</h1>
        <p>A substance is a material with a specific chemical
composition. A substance can be either a
pure chemical element or a pure chemical
compound.
</p>
        <p>Data Loader lets you load substances in the following ways:
</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>Pending Review: Lets you load substances
into the temporary table of Registration
Enterprise. These substances need to be
reviewed before being registered, and
hence they belong to the “Pending Review”
list.</li>
            <li>Registered: Lets you load substances into
both temporary table and permanent table
of Registration Enterprise. Depending on
the circumstances and Duplicate Action settings,
some substances will go into temporary
table instead of permanent table. For
example, when you select the Add to substances
pending review option, duplicate
records go to the temporary table and non-duplicate
records go to permanent table.
The other options allow you to add a substance
as a duplicate registered substance or
a new batch of a registered substance.
</li>
            <li>Register with known RegNum values: Lets
you load substances into Registration Enterprise by specifying the registration
number instead of having it automatically
generated. You can use this option if you
are having external databases that point into
their Registration system.
Duplicate Action settings are also available
with this option.</li>
            <li>Check for Registered Duplicates: this option enables the ‘matching-only’ mode after choosing ‘Load to Registration’, where the choices of registration type and duplicate resolution are presented. Please note that the option is only available for the ‘permanent’ registration workflow.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Note:</b> when Check for Registered Duplicates option is selected, then after the usual data-mapping and range-selection screens, the matching is performed as per the System Settings chosen, and results are displayed. When a compound from the data-file has been matched with an existing registration, the results indicate both the matching mechanism and provide a comma-delimited list of Registered compounds that were matched. Matched compounds are conveniently marked as ‘errors’ to allow the user to easily filter the results using the ‘View only errors’ checkbox.</p>
        <p>To load substances into Registration Enterprise:
</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Log into Data Loader with appropriate credentials
to load data into Registration
Enterprise.
</li>
            <li>Select <b>Load substances to registration </b>option.
</li>
            <li>Click Next. The following screen appears as:

        <p>This screen shows the input fields, output
fields, and their corresponding data types. The
output fields are classified into four sections,
which are:
</p>
        <blockquote>
            <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
                <li>Registration Information
</li>
                <li>Component Information
</li>
                <li>Fragment Information
</li>
                <li>Batch Information
</li>
            </ul>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The above classification is based on the way
records are submitted into Registration Enterprise.
For more information on the output
fields belonging to these sections, see “<a href="Output Fields.htm">Output
fields</a>”.
</p>
        <p>The list of output fields and output field types
depends on the data management task that you
have chosen. You cannot edit the output field
names or data types.
</p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Map output fields to input fields. You can
specify how a particular output field will be
populated. Depending on the output fields,
these options are available in the dropdown
lists of the Value From column:
</li>
        </ol>
        <blockquote>
            <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
                <li>Default: Indicates that the output field
value is optional and is supplied by the
task.
</li>
                <li>Input field: Lets you map an input field.
Only input fields of a compatible data type
may be mapped.
</li>
                <li>Picklist: Lets you choose a value from a
list.
</li>
                <li>Constant: Lets you enter a constant value.
</li>
                <li>Date: Lets you enter date. On clicking the
down arrow next to the date, a standard
date picker appears.
</li>
                <li>Calculation: Lets you map an output file
with the result of a calculation. A dropdown
list appears under the Value column
and displays a small box with ellipsis. The
color of this box indicates whether the formula is valid; green is for valid and red is
for invalid. On clicking the ellipsis inside
this box, the Calculation window appears
as:</li>

passed to the function.
</p>
        <p>On selecting Input field from any of the dropdown
lists under the Value From column, a

        <p>The View only Errors check box allows you to

        <p><b>NOTE:</b> If ChemDraw Chemical Warning Checker is enabled and configured for DataLoader and any loaded record contains ChemDraw chemical warning, that specific record will be added to the temporary records. A description of the chemical warning appears as tooltip when you hover. See figure below:</p>
