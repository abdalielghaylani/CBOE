        <h1>Read Records from the Source File</h1>
        <p>The client application (ie. COEDataLoader) reads the source data (sdf, Excel…) from the file system to parse the content into local client memory.  If the source file type is sdf, then the client will pre-scan all database records in order to establish the data type of each field in the file.  The COEDataLoader application allows interrupting this pre-scan.  Interrupting the pre-scan can save some time for big data files, but does incur a risk that the application may misidentify the data type of a field.  For example if the first few values for a particular data field contain purely numerical values but later values contain string values, then stopping the pre-scan may result in the system incorrectly assuming a numerical data type for a field that contains text values. </p>
