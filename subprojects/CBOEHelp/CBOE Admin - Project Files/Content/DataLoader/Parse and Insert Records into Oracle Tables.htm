        <h1>Parse and Insert Records into Oracle Tables</h1>
        <p>Once the data has been validated and duplicate checked it must be inserted into Oracle tables.  This process involves parsing xml and inserting several data rows into the database.  The process is both CPU and disk IO intensive.  Significant performance boosts can be obtained during bulk loading by ensuring that the database has been properly configured and dimensioned by an experienced Oracle DBA.  In particular, best practices to minimize disk resource contention can have a very positive impact on bulk load scenarios.
