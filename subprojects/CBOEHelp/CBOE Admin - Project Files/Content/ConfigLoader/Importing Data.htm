        <h1>Importing Data</h1>
        <p>The "configuration" files that Config Loader uses are XML files. When you do an import, you choose only the folder that contains the required XML files. Config Loader finds the appropriate files and puts their contents into the database.</p>
        <p>You must have a brand new database before exporting data because this action is intended to be performed only once during initial server setup.</p>
