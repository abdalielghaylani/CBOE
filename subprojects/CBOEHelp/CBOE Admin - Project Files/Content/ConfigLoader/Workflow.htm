        <h1>Workflow</h1>
        <p>Configuration related to registration Enterprise can be done manually using the Registration Enterprise's GUI. The configuration settings are stored in an Oracle database.</p>
        <p>Config Loader helps the service representatives migrate the configuration settings to a brand new installation of Registration Enterprise.</p>
        <p>The workflow of Config Loader is as follows:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Using Config Loader, the service representative exports the configuration settings from Oracle database to the file system as separate files and folders.</li>
            <li>The service representative copies the exported files to the recipient system, usually a new customer installation where Config Loader has been installed and configured to interact with the database.</li>
            <li>Config Loader is run on the client system to import the configuration files from the file system into the database.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Config Loader serves two primary purposes:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>Lets you import ChemBioOffice Enterprise's customized XML files into a database. These XML files contain data related to data views and forms used in Registration Enterprise.</li>
            <li>Lets you export data to an XML file.</li>
        </ul>
