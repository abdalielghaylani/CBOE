        <h1>Linking to Parent Compound Records</h1>
        <p>If you have Document Manager installed and
Drug Degradation is configured to integrate
with DocManager, you can add document links
to parent compound records. The Add Doc Link
button will appear at the bottom of the parent

limited to the documents in the Document
