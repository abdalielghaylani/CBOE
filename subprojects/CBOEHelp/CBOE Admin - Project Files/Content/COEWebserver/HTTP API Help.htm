        <h1>HTTP API Help</h1>
        <p>ChemOffice WebServer applications are typically driven from dynamically generated web pages created by the server itself.  That is, a user can query the server by entering search parameters into an HTML form hosted on the web server, and search results are passed back to the browser as HTML.  However, the ChemOffice WebServer also supports remote requests from applications capable of sending/receiving HTTP requests/responses.  This allows for external applications to initiate searches on the server and to take on the responsibility of post-processing and/or displaying the search results.  The following is a list of remote requests to the server:

        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li><a href="Search.htm">search</a>
            </li>
            <li><a href="Get_structure.htm">get_structure </a>
            </li>
            <li><a href="Query_string.htm">query_string</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
