        <h1>FORCE_ORACLE_SESSION_CURSOR_SHARING</h1>
        <p>Example: FORCE_ORACLE_SESSION_CURSOR_SHARING=1

</p>
        <p>Description: Indicates if cursor charing is used during searching and large data loads.  Although the default is zero, in general, this should be turned on (set to 1) in order to improve performance.  All versions of Oracle 9i can utilize this feature, but only some versions of Oracle 8i show improvement with this set to 1 (e.g. Windows 8i version shows no improvement so this flag should be set to 0).  In general, if you are using Oracle 9i, set this value to 1.  If you are using Oracle 8i, set this to 0.

</p>
        <p>Default: 0
</p>
        <p>Options: 0 | 1
