        <h1>The Command-Line Version of Data Loader</h1>
        <p>The command-line based application is a more powerful version of the original DataLoader, but does require the user to create at least one xml file using a text editor. This xml file is called a ‘mapping file’, and tells the program exactly how to migrate your data-file’s information into the Registration system.
Mapping files may seem, and even look, quite complicated, but you can actually create them by copying and pasting individual mapping templates from the mapping-samples appendix. Once you have one mapping file completed, you can make copies of it, make small changes to each of those copies, and very quickly be importing data from many file formats with different field names.</p>
        <p>The Command-Line includes the following features:</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Separating the data-mappings from the data:</p>
        <p>Regardless of the file format your data is in, if those files have the same field names, you can make a single mapping file and re-use it for each data-file. If your MSExcel worksheet headers differ from your SDFile field names, you can create a complete mapping file for one data-source (the worksheet, for example) and, using copy/paste/edit, create the mapping file needed for the SDFile.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Splitting your data:</p>
        <p>Some activities you ask the DataLoader2 to perform will create result in the creation of new data-files that represent sub-sets of your original files.</p>
        <p>If you have the program search for potential duplicates using “StructureFile.sdf”, the program may create two new files: those records which were matched with existing registrations (“StructureFile.structuredup.sdf”) and those which were not (StructureFile.unique.sdf). Each file will be in the original file format, and ready to be imported or viewed with ChemBioFinder, etc.</p>
        <p>In fact, sometimes the data in certain records is considered invalid – a common example is when one of the mapped data-fields has text exceeding the allowable text length configured by your system administrator. In that case, you may also see a third file, “StructureFile.invalid.sdf”, which contains the original SD records which would have failed during data-import.</p>
        <p>Lastly, for very large data-files, the program has a special action that allows you to create new, smaller files from the original.</p>
        <p>In all cases, if the starting file is SDFile format, the output files will also be that format. For all other data-formats, the output format will be CSV format (character-separated values). So, if a user performs duplicate-checking using an MS Excel 2007 worksheet, the output files will be plain-text TXT files and not XLS format.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Easy-to-read logging:</p>
        <p>All program functions allow a user to track their progress by watching the console window where they execute. Most functions also create a plain-text, easy-to-read log file that is automatically opened (typically in Windows Notepad) when the program has finished running. The output is simple and has a summary section at the end of the file.</p>
