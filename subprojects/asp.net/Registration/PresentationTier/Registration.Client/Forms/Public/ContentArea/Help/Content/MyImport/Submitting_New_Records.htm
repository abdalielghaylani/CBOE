        <div class="Body">You can submit a registry record containing a single component, multiple components, or batch information. You can submit a record to the temporary table in the database or, if you have adequate privileges, register the record directly to the permanent table.</div>
        <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="Submit_Records_2794373798_1002876"></a>Pure compounds</h3>
        <div class="Body">In Registration Enterprise, a chemical compound is a pure chemical substance consisting of two or more different chemical elements that can be separated into simpler substances by chemical reactions and that have a unique and defined chemical structure. </div>
        <div class="Body">For example, a pure compound can be compound molecules held together by covalent bonds, salts held together by ionic bonds, metallic compounds held together by metallic bonds, or complexes held together by coordinate covalent bonds. </div>
        <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="Submit_Records_2794373798_1002878"></a>Mixtures</h3>
        <div class="Body">In Registration Enterprise, a mixture is a substance that consists of two or more pure substances mixed together but not chemically combined with each other in a definite composition. The molecules of two or more different substances are mixed in the form of solutions, suspensions, and colloids. The physical properties of a mixture, such as its melting point, may differ from those of its components. Mixtures can usually be separated into its original components by mechanical means. </div>
        <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="Submit_Records_2794373798_1002858"></a>Batch</h3>
        <div class="Body">A batch is a set of synthesis of a substance. For example, if you synthesize the same substance twice, you will have two batches of the same substance.</div>
