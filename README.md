# ChemBioOffice Enterprise

## Overview

The ChemBioOffice Enterprise suite allows you to record, manage, and share a wide variety of R&D information. Diverse types of data display on electronic “pages” in E-Notebook, and other applications. You can retrieve information from an extensive set of databases with an easy-to-use Web-based interface.

CBOE includes the following applications:

**E-Notebook Client**: Select Launch E-Notebook to install the E-Notebook Client. E-Notebook facilitates daily record-keeping for scientists. With E-Notebook, makes it possible for users to manage diverse types of data on electronic “pages”. The electronic pages (sections/experiments) make it easy to organize information and streamline your workflow. With E-Notebook; users can manage information about organic syntheses and related items such as stoichiometry calculations, reaction preparations, spectra, analytical methods, notes, and spreadsheets.

Additional E-Notebook Add-ins, for example, BioAssay, Formulations, and so on, facilitate a variety of work flows in these disciplines. The integration between E-Notebook and ChemBioOffice Enterprise lets you:

- Add reactants from Inventory, Registration, and ChemACX databases
- Manage and register samples
- Create containers in inventory
- Launch ChemBioOffice applications, such as, Registration and Inventory from E-Notebook via hyperlinks created in the Sample Information and Reaction sections.

**Registration Enterprise**: Assigns corporate registration number for compounds based on your organizations business rules. Registration lets you register your organization's compounds and mixtures to a common database. 

**Inventory Enterprise**: Manages and tracks chemical and biological reagents in laboratories and research centers in multiple contexts.

**ChemACX**: Available Chemical Exchange is a read-only database of chemical products currently available from chemical manufacturers and distributors. For more information, refer to the ChemACX chapter.

**Chemical Databases**: Searches content from PerkinElmer and custom databases such as Inventory, Registration, and ChemACX.

**Applications and Utilities**: Provides a list of available client installations and utilities. Note: Not all users have the same applications and utilities; it depends upon each user's security settings. One available application is ChemDraw, which is the primary molecular structure and reaction drawing tool used in E-Notebook and in ChemBioOffice Enterprise.
