Registration System</font></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">As a major feature of Registration System 10.0, the
<a href="../../../../../../../Chem3D/Chem3D11.0/Projects/ChemScript/index.htm">ChemScript</a> 
feature is functioning as follows per our discussion:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p align="left">Provide structure transformation in Reg database</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left">From Registration System, after a structure is inserted into 
  temporary table, Reg calls up to ChemScript via webservice, to perform 
  transformation of the structure. The ChemScript scripts are defined by Reg admin 
  at certain location, which is defined as a setting in reg ini file.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p align="left">Provide built-in Salt Stripping based on <a href="#immetech">
  IMMETECH requests</a>.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left">The built-in Salt Stripping happens when the structure is 
  inserted into the permanent table. Reg calls out the ChemScript web service 
  with the structure and other info, the web service returns the modified 
  molecule and mutiple fragments, being salts and solvates. Then Reg goes on the 
  logic and make decisions of processing the salts and solvates.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">Possible technical routes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p align="left">Reg asp --&gt; PL/SQL --&gt; ChemScript web service --&gt; ChemScript 
  --&gt; PL/SQL finish up the reg logic --&gt; return to asp </li>
  <li>
  <p align="left">Reg asp --&gt; ChemScript web service --&gt; ChemScript --&gt;return to 
  asp --&gt; asp finish up the reg logic</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">Tasks:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p align="left">Create GUI for manage and maintain Fragments table. </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left">Fragments table is where the fragments like salts and solvates 
  are defined, it is focusing on structure of the fragments, where SALTS and 
  SOLVANTS table are focusing on properties and other info.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p align="left">Web Service location configured in the ini file.</li>
  <li>
  <p align="left">ChemScript file location is configured in teh ini file.</li>
  <li>
  <p align="left">ini setting to turn salt stripping on and off.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">Time Line:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p align="left">Deliver mid summer.</li>

<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">Dan,&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#003399">
<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">Thank you for working on this 
issue within your limited available time. What I “would like to see here” is a 
CambridgeSoft, not a ChemScript, solution to one of my requirements, i.e., being 
able to port all the salt/solvent information into the ChemReg database. It is 
clear that ChemScript cannot handle this requirement by itself.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#003399">
<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">Given 1) ChemScript’s (or 
Cheshire’s) limitations as a standalone tool, 2) ChemScript’s (current) lack of 
integration with ChemReg, and ChemReg’s (current) limitations on handling 
salt/solvate information, I suggest the following steps for handling the 
salt/solvate info:</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#003399">
<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;- ChemScript neutralizes the 
parent structure, if needed</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#003399">
<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;- ChemScript strips any 
salts/solvates from the parent structure; may check to confirm that the stripped 
salt/solvate’s MF matches as a substring in the Analysis field</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#003399">
<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;- ChemScript provides updated 
batch MF and MW in new SDfile fields; MF should 1) include any salt/solvate from 
the original SDfile’s Structure, Analysis, and Salt tags, and 2) be calculated 
using ChemReg format; MW should be calculated from MF; a visual (or 
programmatic) comparison with Analysis and Mol_Wt field data should be done in 
the new SDfile</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#003399">
<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;- ChemLoader should be able 
to load these new (batch MF and MW) data into the corresponding ChemReg database 
fields; DGosalvez should confirm if this is possible and how to manage the 
related salt/solvate fields (equivalents, etc.)</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#003399">
<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;I base my suggestions above 
on my very limited use of ChemReg; if my ChemReg assumptions are false, you may 
disregard the above steps. If true, however, it seems that ChemScript should be 
able to handle all the above steps. I don’t see any need at this point to 
upgrade the SDfile structure filed with salt info (as suggested previously) if 
ChemReg cannot process it. </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#003399">
<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">Per your previous statements, 
please 1) provide the “sample apps”, not just the “sample scripts”, 2) provide 
“salt stripping functionality” as “demonstrated to other customers”, and 3) put 
me on your “short-list of people who get preliminary copies of the 
documentation”.&nbsp; I requested the APIs (under construction). Other ChemScript 
features that I’m interested in include structure cleanup, structure orientation 
(for SAR purposes), geometric transformations (rotation, translation, scaling, 
reflection, group flipping), measurements (distance, angle, atom/bond type 
count).</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#003399">
<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">Thanks,</span></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#003399">
<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">P.S. You should add water as a 
solvate, not a solvent. To me and all vendors except CS, there is no difference 
between a salt and a solvate as “chemical information” buzzwords. They are 
mainly used to calculate the batch MF and MF. MDL uses the “addend” word to 
reflect any one of them. </span></font></p>

much more behind the scenes.&nbsp; The process to be automated is as follows:</span></font></p>

Cheshire and that this is a cake-walk with that product.&nbsp; The question is where 
does this fit in our plans? &nbsp;And when?&nbsp; He would be willing to wait until 
mid-Summer, but no longer. &nbsp;Additionally, just to recap, he would expect this to 
run as an automated process against an existing database described in (1) above, 
and then as new databases are merged into that one going forward.</span></font></p>

<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">I suggested a follow-up

you would be better positioned to explain how we will do this. &nbsp;Let me know asap
