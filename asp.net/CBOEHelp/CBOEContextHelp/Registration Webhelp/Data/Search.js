Registration Enterprise provides a friendly user interface allowing users to register their organization\'s components and mixtures to a common database. Users can add, search, edit components and batches and share registration records over a network through a simple and user-friendly graphical interface. Any user can immediately track the records submitted by another user, enabling them to gather information stored in the database easily and quickly.\" /><Url Source=\"../Content/Reg 1104/Registration Terminology.htm\" Title=\"Registration Terminology\" Abstract=\"Registration User \'s Guide Registration Terminology Pure Compounds: In Registration Enterprise, a chemical compound is a pure chemical substance consisting of two or more different chemical elements that can be separated into simpler substances by chemical reactions and that have a unique and defined chemical structure.\" /><Url Source=\"../Content/Reg 1104/The_registration_process.htm\" Title=\"The registration process\" Abstract=\"Registration User \'s Guide The Registration Process The registration process includes the following steps in order:\" /><Url Source=\"../Content/Reg 1104/Integration.htm\" Title=\"Integration\" Abstract=\"Registration User \'s Guide Integration Registration can be integrated with other  CambridgeSoft applications such as Inventory Enterprise, ChemACX database, BioSAR Enterprise, BioAssay Enterprise, and E-Notebook. When integrated, Registration provides a solution to the problems associated with organizing, storing, and sharing chemical information. Each product shares information through common databases. Each product also provides interfaces to operations performed in different applications. For example, it is possible to register a compound in Registration Enterprise through E-Notebook or BioAssay. Sharing a common database makes all information consistent with a change in any one application.This means that every user in the research and development process has access to the up-to-date data. It saves time and reduces the number of errors in re-interpreting and re-entering data in multiple locations.\" /><Url Source=\"../Content/Reg 1104/Getting_Started.htm\" Title=\"Logging in\" Abstract=\"Registration User \'s Guide Getting Started The first step to make before being able to submit a component or search for a component in Registration Enterprise, is logging into the ChemBioOffice Enterprise Manager home page.\" /><Url Source=\"../Content/Reg 1104/Logging_in to Registration.htm\" Title=\"Logging in\" Abstract=\"Registration User \'s Guide Logging in to Registration To open the Registration Enterprise home page: Enter http://servername/COEManager into your web browser address bar. &lt;servername&gt; is the name of the server where ChemBioOffice Enterprise  is installed.
